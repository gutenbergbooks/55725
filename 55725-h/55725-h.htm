<small>THE TRAIN FOR CHICAGO.</small></h2></div>


<p>The four o'clock afternoon train from Milwaukee,
bound for Chicago, had just passed Truesdell, when
the train boy passed through the cars with a pile of
magazines under his arm.</p>

<p>He handed them to the right and left for passengers
to examine, and after an interval passed back again, to
receive pay for any that might be selected, and gather
up the rest.</p>

<p>"Here's the latest magazines!" he cried, in a pleasant
voice. "Harpers, Scribner's, Lippincott's!"</p>

<p>As he is to be our hero, I will pause a moment to
sketch Paul Palmer.</p>

<p>He was a boy of sixteen, of medium height for a
boy of that age, with dark brown hair, bright, sparkling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
eyes, not without a suggestion of mirthfulness,
and round cheeks, with a healthful color. It would
be hard to find a more attractive-looking boy than
Paul.</p>

<p>The first passenger he came to on his return round
was an old lady, bordering upon seventy, who was
quite unaccustomed to traveling, and knew very little
of railways and their customs.</p>

<p>When the magazine had been put in her hands she
received it with glad complacency, supposing it to be a
gift from the railroad corporation.</p>

<p>She hunted up her spectacles, and was looking at
the pictures with considerable interest when Paul
touched her on the arm.</p>

<p>"Want my ticket a'ready?" she asked, thinking it
to be the conductor.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," answered Paul, smiling. "Please
give me the magazine."</p>

<p>"Why, you give it to me yourself," said the old
lady in surprise.</p>

<p>"No, I only handed it to you to examine," said
Paul.</p>

<p>"I thought, to be sure, you give it to me, and I
was goin' to carry it to my darter Sarah Ann as a present.
I'm goin' to spend a week with Sarah Ann."</p>

<p>Paul smiled.</p>

<p>He had met before unsophisticated travelers ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to impart their family affairs to any one sufficiently interested
to listen to them.</p>

<p>"You can do it now," he said, "if you will buy
the magazine. Every body likes to read Harper's."</p>

<p>"How much do you ax for it?" asked the old lady,
cautiously.</p>

<p>"Thirty-five cents."</p>

<p>"Lands sake!" exclaimed the old lady, in dismay.
"Thirty-five cents for a picture-book!"</p>

<p>"There's some very nice reading in it, ma'am," said
Paul, patiently.</p>

<p>"Maybe there is, but there ain't any covers."</p>

<p>"If there were I should ask a good deal more."</p>

<p>"I'll pay you ten cents," said the old lady, with the
air of one who was making a very liberal offer.</p>

<p>"Couldn't take it, ma'am. I should fail if I did
business that way," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you'd better take it, then. I can't
afford to pay thirty-five cents for a picture-book."</p>

<p>Paul took the magazine, and passed on.</p>

<p>The next passenger was a young lady. She, too,
had Harper's magazine in her hand.</p>

<p>"Won't you take fifteen cents for it?" she asked,
with a smile, for she had heard the colloquy between
Paul and the old lady.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not," said Paul, smiling back, for he
understood her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>"Then I must pay your price."</p>

<p>She drew out a purse, through the meshes of which
gleamed not only silver but gold, and put half a dollar
into Paul's hand.</p>

<p>He was about to return her fifteen cents in change,
when she said, pleasantly:</p>

<p>"Never mind. Keep the change for yourself."</p>

<p>"Thank you," answered Paul, politely. "I should
be glad of many customers like yourself."</p>

<p>"Have you parents living?" asked the young lady.</p>

<p>"My mother is living, but my father died two years
since."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you help your mother with your
earnings?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss, I give them all to her."</p>

<p>"I was sure you were a good boy," said the young
lady, with a charming smile. "Tell me, now, do you
earn good wages by selling papers and magazines on
the train?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss, more than I could get in a store or
office. Last week I made eight dollars. Some lucky
weeks I have made as much as eleven."</p>

<p>"Have you no brother or sister?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a little sister, ten years old."</p>

<p>"And a brother?"</p>

<p>"I have a half-brother&mdash;ten years older than myself,"
answered Paul, with evident hesitation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>"And does he help your mother also?" inquired
the young lady.</p>

<p>Paul shook his head.</p>

<p>"We don't see much of him," he answered. "He
isn't very steady, and is more likely to ask help of us
than to give it."</p>

<p>"And he is a strong, young man!" exclaimed the
young lady, indignantly. "Why, he can't have any
sense of pride or honor."</p>

<p>"Not much. We can do better without him than
with him."</p>

<p>"It is lucky for your mother and sister that you are
different from him."</p>

<p>"That is true enough, miss. I should be ashamed
to act like him."</p>

<p>"What is your little sister's name?"</p>

<p>"Grace."</p>

<p>"Why, that is my name. She is a namesake of
mine."</p>

<p>"Then I hope she will be like her namesake," said
Paul, gallantly.</p>

<p>"I see you are old enough to pay compliments,"
said the young lady, smiling. "Do you know what I
feel like doing?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I am going to send a gift to my namesake.
Here;" and, opening her purse once more, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
drew from it a two dollar and a half gold piece,
and put it into Paul's hand.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean this for Grace?" asked the
boy, almost incredulous.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Though you never saw her?"</p>

<p>"I have seen her brother," said the young lady,
"and I have a very good opinion of him."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. Grace will be delighted."</p>

<p>"Do you live in Chicago?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss."</p>

<p>"Some time bring your little sister to call on me.
I live with my aunt, Mrs. Sheldon, in Ashland avenue."</p>

<p>She handed Paul her card. Glancing at it, he ascertained
that the name of his liberal friend was Grace
Dearborn.</p>

<p>"Grace shall certainly come, if only to thank you
for her present," said Paul.</p>

<p>After the boy passed on, Mrs. Sheldon, who sat in
the seat just behind, said:</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Grace, you are extremely liberal
to a perfect stranger."</p>

<p>"No doubt, aunt; but I took a fancy to the boy."</p>

<p>"How do you know he told you the truth?"</p>

<p>"I would stake my life upon his truth," said Grace,
warmly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>"Did you ever see him before?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheldon shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You must have great confidence in your knowledge
of human nature, then," she said.</p>

<p>"I have, aunt," said the young lady, smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, you are rich, and are quite able to
indulge your quixotic liberality."</p>

<p>"Thanks to Providence, aunt."</p>

<p>"And to your father."</p>

<p>The two would have taken seats beside each other
had there been an opportunity, but when they entered
the car the best they could do was to take outside seats,
one directly behind the other.</p>

<p>Miss Dearborn's seat companion was a young man
of about thirty, with a complexion preternaturally
pale, the pallor being heightened by his intensely
black hair and mustache.</p>

<p>He was well dressed, and on the middle finger of
his right hand he wore a cameo ring, which was apparently
of considerable value.</p>

<p>When Grace Dearborn was holding her colloquy
with Paul, the young man glanced from behind the
paper he was reading, and took notice of the well-filled
purse which she displayed.</p>

<p>There was a covetous glitter in his eyes, which could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
hardly have been expected from one whose appearance
seemed to indicate that he was in easy circumstances.</p>

<p>He noticed also that Grace replaced the purse in a
pocket on the side nearest to him.</p>

<p>"I must have that purse," said Luke Denton to
himself.</p>

<p>I may as well say that Denton, originally of good
family, had so given himself up to evil courses that
he had been disowned by his relatives, and was reduced
to making a living by preying upon the community.</p>

<p>In fact, he was an unscrupulous adventurer, and not
above being a thief.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>A LEAP FROM THE TRAIN.</small></h2></div>


<p>Luke Denton still held the paper before him, and
appeared to be reading it; but it had ceased to have
an interest for him. He cast furtive glances from behind
it at the young lady by his side, and watched for
an opportunity to transfer to his own pocket the coveted
purse.</p>

<p>This was likely to be more easily effected because
Grace Dearborn, though she had taken but slight
notice of him, had made up her mind from a casual
glance that he was what is technically called a gentleman.
That her purse was in danger from a man so
well dressed never occurred to her.</p>

<p>It so happened that Grace was an interested observer
of nature, and so as the train sped over the road
she looked, now out of the windows at one side, now
out of them at the other.</p>

<p>To a novice, theft under such circumstances would
have been difficult, but it was not the first time Luke
Denton had practiced the art of a pickpocket.</p>

<p>He seized the opportunity when Grace was looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
across the car, stealthily to insert his hand into her
pocket and draw therefrom the well-filled purse, the
young lady meanwhile being quite unconscious that
she was suffering a loss.</p>

<p>Her aunt, too, had her attention otherwise bestowed,
for she was reading the magazine which her
niece had just bought of the train boy.</p>

<p>It looked as if Luke would easily be able to escape
with his booty before his theft could be discovered.
Indeed he had made up his mind to leave the train at
Libertyville, a small station close at hand, so as to be
out of the way when Grace realized her loss; but, unfortunately
for him, there had been an unsuspected
witness of his adroit act.</p>

<p>Paul was just entering the car at the moment, and
his first glance, not unnaturally, was directed toward
the pretty young lady who had shown herself so generous
to his little sister.</p>

<p>He was startled when he saw her pocket being
picked, and was rather surprised that the gentlemanly
looking person at her side should be the
thief.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to go forward, apprise Miss
Dearborn of her loss, and denounce her seat companion.
But this might enable Luke to drop the purse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and assume the airs of an innocent man. Perhaps
Denton in his rage might even attack him.</p>

<p>Paul therefore framed a different plan.</p>

<p>He passed through the car into the next, where he
met the conductor. To him he briefly communicated
what he had seen.</p>

<p>"You have done right, Paul," said the conductor,
who personally knew him. "Ten to one the gentleman
will be for getting out at Libertyville, unless we
are beforehand with him. There is no time to be lost,
as we are only about a mile from the station. Come
back with me."</p>

<p>The conductor entered the car where Grace was
seated, with Paul close at his heels.</p>

<p>Luke Denton was looking out of the window, having
folded his newspaper.</p>

<p>"In five minutes I shall be safe," thought he, as
not far ahead he caught a distant view of the few
houses which constituted Libertyville.</p>

<p>The purse he had slipped into the pocket of his
pantaloons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the conductor and Paul had approached,
and stood beside the seat.</p>

<p>"Miss Dearborn," said Paul, as the young lady
looked up with a smile of recognition, "will you feel
for your purse?"</p>

<p>The young lady looked surprised, and Luke Denton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
startled. He was not ready to commit himself,
however, not yet being sure that his agency was suspected.</p>

<p>Grace felt in her pocket, and said, in surprise:</p>

<p>"It is gone!"</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" ejaculated Denton, affecting surprise.
"Perhaps it dropped on the floor."</p>

<p>He was trying slyly to get at his pocket to see that
the purse was found on the floor, when Paul said:</p>

<p>"It is in that man's pocket!"</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon Denton, who, with a
fierce oath, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Boy, take care how you insult <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>"I am only telling the truth," said Paul, steadily.</p>

<p>With a glance of alarm and distrust Grace ran precipitately
from her seat, and Luke Denton was not
slow in seizing the opportunity to escape.</p>

<p>He jumped up, nearly overturned the conductor,
as he dashed down the aisle, flung open the door of
the car, and with the recklessness born of desperation
and the fear of arrest, with only an instant's hesitation,
<i>jumped from the platform</i>!</p>

<p>The train was not going at full speed. As it approached
Libertyville if was moving slowly, and probably
the rate of speed did not exceed fifteen miles per
hour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>"Good heavens, the man will be killed!" said
Grace, alarmed.</p>

<p>The conductor sprang to the platform, and so did
Paul.</p>

<p>They saw Denton roll over once or twice, and then
pick himself up, apparently not seriously injured.</p>

<p>"The fellow is safe!" he said, turning to Miss
Dearborn.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!"</p>

<p>"But he has carried off your purse."</p>

<p>"I don't care for that. That is, I don't care for it
in comparison with the man's life."</p>

<p>"You are more good-natured than many would be
who had suffered such a loss."</p>

<p>"There wasn't a large sum of money in the purse,"
said Grace.</p>

<p>"Do you remember how much?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"I had fifty dollars when I left Milwaukee."</p>

<p>"And you gave me two dollars and a half for my
little sister."</p>

<p>"And bought a <i>Harper's Magazine</i> of you," added
Grace, smiling.</p>

<p>"Then there should be forty-seven dollars left,"
continued the train boy.</p>

<p>"I suppose so. I wish now I had given you the
whole of it for your little sister."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>"You were very generous as it was, Miss Dearborn."</p>

<p>"Still I think it would have done her more good
than the gentleman who so unceremoniously borrowed
it."</p>

<p>"Miss Dearborn," said Paul, with a sudden reflection,
"now that you have lost all your money, let me
hand you back this gold piece."</p>

<p>And he offered her the quarter-eagle which she had
given him for his little sister.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, there is no need that I should recall my
gift," she said, shaking her head. "To be sure I am
temporarily penniless, but my aunt will see that I
don't want. Aunt Caroline, is my credit good with
you?"</p>

<p>"To be sure, Grace," said the matronly lady whom
she addressed.</p>

<p>"And you can certify that the loss of my purse
won't embarrass me seriously?"</p>

<p>"I think not," said Mrs. Sheldon, "considering
that you have an income of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here she stepped discreetly, just as she was about
to reveal an important secret.</p>

<p>"Say six hundred dollars a year," chimed in Grace,
laughing. "You see, Paul," she continued, addressing
our hero, "you need have no compunctions about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
keeping my gift to your sister. It won't entail any distressing
economy."</p>

<p>They had reached Libertyville, and Paul went out
on the platform with his papers.</p>

<p>Of course nothing was to be seen or heard of Denton,
who had jumped off the train fully three-quarters
of a mile back.</p>

<p>To the station master the conductor hurriedly communicated
what had passed, and enjoined him to detain
Denton if he should appear at the station, and
try to purchase a ticket for the seven o'clock train,
which would start a little over an hour later.</p>

<p>Again the train moved on.</p>

<p>"There is no loss without some little gain, Aunt
Caroline," said Grace. "As my seat companion has
taken French leave, there will be room for you to sit
beside me the rest of the journey."</p>

<p>"Rather dearly purchased, Grace," said the elder
lady, "since it costs you forty-seven dollars."</p>

<p>"Oh, I consider your company worth that sum,"
said the young lady, playfully.</p>

<p>"Really, Grace, you have taken your loss very
coolly."</p>

<p>"Would it do any good to make a lament over it,
aunt?"</p>

<p>"No, perhaps not, but you seem in just as good
spirits as if you had lost nothing."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>"So I am, but I should not be if I were a poor
seamstress, or a milliner's apprentice, for instance.
Then it would be a serious thing for me."</p>

<p>"Well, Grace, all I can say is that it would annoy
me very much if I had met with such a loss. I dare
say I shouldn't sleep to-night."</p>

<p>"That would be foolish, aunt, to lose sleep as well
as money."</p>

<p>At seven o'clock the train ran into the depot, and
Miss Dearborn and her aunt rose from their seats.</p>

<p>"Can I call a carriage, Miss Dearborn?" asked
Paul, politely.</p>

<p>"If you please, Paul."</p>

<p>"My dear, you are too familiar with that boy," said
Mrs. Sheldon, while Paul was gone in search of a
hack.</p>

<p>"He seems very well bred, aunt, and he is certainly
polite and obliging."</p>

<p>"Come and see me, and bring your little sister,"
said Grace, smiling, as Paul handed her into the hack
and closed the door after her.</p>

<p>Paul touched his hat, and then, leaving the depot,
bent his steps toward his humble home, where supper
and a warm welcome awaited him.</p>

<small>PAUL PALMER AT HOME.</small></h2></div>


<p>In a small two-story house, not far from the junction
of a side street with Lake street, lived Mrs. Palmer,
Paul's mother.</p>

<p>It was rather shabby-looking externally, being sadly
in want of paint, but Mrs. Palmer's rooms on the second
floor were neatly, though plainly furnished, and
scrupulously clean.</p>

<p>There was an outside staircase, so that the second
floor was independent of the first.</p>

<p>Paul ran up stairs, and opened the door, entering at
once into the sitting-room, where his mother and sister
were seated.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer's face brightened at the sight of Paul.
He was always full of life and gayety, and his coming
never failed to cheer her.</p>

<p>"So you are back again, Paul," she said, smiling a
welcome.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, and I am hungry, I can tell you. Is
supper most ready?"</p>

<p>"It will be in five minutes," said his mother, folding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
up her work and going into the adjoining room.
"I have got some dipped toast for you to-night."</p>

<p>"Just what I like."</p>

<p>"But I delayed putting the toast into the dip till
you came. There is some minced meat."</p>

<p>"In other words, hash," said Paul, laughing.</p>

<p>"I think you will find it good, in spite of the
name."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure to like it, since it is home-made.
At the restaurants I am a little afraid; I don't know
but it may be made of dogs or cats."</p>

<p>"Do they make it of dogs or cats, Paul?" asked his
little sister, curiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Paul; "I won't swear to it.
All I know is that there's a lot of dogs and cats that
disappear mysteriously every year in Chicago."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Palmer had been busily completing
her arrangements for supper, and it was ready within
the five minutes mentioned.</p>

<p>"Supper's ready, Paul. I haven't made you wait
long," she said.</p>

<p>"No, mother; you're always on time, like an express
train."</p>

<p>"What sort of a day have you had, Paul? Did you
sell much?"</p>

<p>"Yes, more than usual. How much do you think
I made?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>"A dollar and a quarter?"</p>

<p>"More than that. A dollar and seventy-five cents."</p>

<p>"That is very good indeed. It would take me a
week to make as much as that by sewing."</p>

<p>"They pay mean wages for sewing, mother. I
wouldn't slave at that kind of work."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to depend upon that kind of work
altogether, but I can just as well earn something that
way. I don't want you to support Grace and me in
idleness."</p>

<p>"No danger of your being idle, mother. That
doesn't come natural to you. Some time or other I
hope to support you as a lady."</p>

<p>"I hope you will be prospered, Paul; but I shall
never be willing to fold my hands and do nothing."</p>

<p>"Then again I don't want always to live in this poor
place," pursued Paul.</p>

<p>"It is comfortable. I feel fortunate in having so
good a home."</p>

<p>"It would be easier to find a better one if we could
afford to pay more rent. Of course this will do for the
present. What have you been doing to-day, Grace?"</p>

<p>"I went to school this morning, and I have been
studying arithmetic and geography at home since
school was over."</p>

<p>"You will become a famous scholar in time,
Grace."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>"I never expect to know as much as mother," said
Grace.</p>

<p>"I hope you will know a good deal more," said
Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p>"You know ever so much, mother."</p>

<p>"You think so now, because I know more than
you; but the time will come when you will understand
better how little your mother knows."</p>

<p>"Didn't you use to keep school, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but school-teachers don't know everything.
Well, Paul, what have you seen to-day? To go to
Milwaukee and back would be a great event to Grace
and myself in our quiet course of life."</p>

<p>"I've got used to it, mother. It's all in the day's
work. Oh, I mustn't forget to tell you a lady had her
pocket picked on our train to-day."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it, Paul," said Grace, with eager
interest.</p>

<p>So Paul told the story, very much as it has already
been told in the last chapter.</p>

<p>"Did the pickpocket really jump off the train when
it was going?" asked Grace, her eyes wide open.</p>

<p>"Yes, Grace."</p>

<p>"Did he get hurt?"</p>

<p>"No; the conductor and I watched from the platform,
and saw him turn two or three somersets, but he
got up quickly and made off."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>"It was taking a dangerous risk," said Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p>"Yes; it is more of a risk than I would take for
forty-seven dollars."</p>

<p>"Was that the sum taken?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Poor young lady! What a loss it will be to her!"</p>

<p>"She happens to be a rich young lady, mother.
She didn't mind it any more than I would if I should
lose ten cents, and perhaps not as much."</p>

<p>"Do you think the man will be caught, Paul?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I suppose he will keep in hiding
for awhile. Anyhow, he got off with the money. I
suppose he doesn't feel very friendly to me, as I was
the one who detected him in the theft."</p>

<p>"Does he know that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer looked rather alarmed.</p>

<p>"Be on your guard against him, Paul. He may do
you a mischief sometime."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt he would like to; but I don't believe
he will ride on that railroad again very soon, and
I would not recommend him to go about much in
Chicago."</p>

<p>"How do you know the lady was rich, Paul?"
asked Grace.</p>

<p>"I know more than that. I know what her name
is," said Paul.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Grace Dearborn."</p>

<p>"Why, her first name is the same as mine."</p>

<p>"So it is. Don't you think she might send a present
to her namesake?"</p>

<p>"She doesn't know anything about me," said the
little girl.</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that."</p>

<p>"How should she?"</p>

<p>"Because I told her. I can tell you something
more. She sent you a present."</p>

<p>"Really and truly?" asked Grace, in a flutter of excitement.</p>

<p>"Yes, really and truly. Now what do you hope it
is?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. I should like a nice doll.
I've got a rag baby, but that isn't as good."</p>

<p>"She didn't send you a doll."</p>

<p>"No; I didn't expect she would; she wouldn't have
any with her."</p>

<p>"No; young ladies do not generally carry dolls
round with them. Still, you can buy a doll with what
she did give you."</p>

<p>Paul drew from his vest-pocket the small gold piece,
and handed it to his little sister.</p>

<p>"How much is it, Paul?" asked Grace, who wasn't
in the habit of seeing gold coin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>"Two dollars and a half, Gracie."</p>

<p>"Why, that's ever so much money. I can get a
nice doll on State street for half a dollar."</p>

<p>"So you can, and keep the rest of the money for
something useful."</p>

<p>"Miss Dearborn was very kind," said Mrs. Palmer.
"I suppose she made the present before she lost her
purse."</p>

<p>"Yes. She invited me to bring Grace to call upon
her some day. She lives on Ashland avenue."</p>

<p>"I should like to go, Paul."</p>

<p>"So you shall, Gracie."</p>

<p>Meanwhile all the family had done justice to the
supper, which, though certainly very plain, was palatable.</p>

<p>As they rose from the supper-table, Paul took his
hat from a peg, and said:</p>

<p>"I'll take a little walk, mother."</p>

<p>"In what direction, Paul?"</p>

<p>"I shall go to Randolph street, and perhaps stroll
down as far as State street. It is rather lively that
way."</p>

<p>"Very well, Paul. I suppose you won't be out
late?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I always tell you beforehand when I stay
out."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Paul had hardly been gone twenty minutes when an
unsteady step was heard on the staircase outside, and
there was a loud knock on the outer door.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's Stephen," said Mrs. Palmer, nervously.
"I wish Paul were at home!"</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>AN UNWELCOME VISITOR.</small></h2></div>


<p>Mrs. Palmer herself went to the door and opened
it. There entered a thickset young man, of very dark
complexion, with an unhealthy color on his bloated
cheeks. His dress was disarranged, his hat sat on his
head with a rakish slant downward, revealing coarse,
unkempt black hair.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, mother," said the new-comer, staggering
forward and sinking into the rocking-chair
usually occupied by the widow herself.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Stephen," said Mrs. Palmer,
gravely.</p>

<p>"Evenin', sister Grace," said the intruder, looking
about for a glimpse of the little girl, who was staring
at him uneasily.</p>

<p>The little girl responded reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Where's Paul?" he asked next.</p>

<p>"He's gone out for a short walk."</p>

<p>"No matter. I don't like Paul; he puts on airs.
He doesn't treat me with the respect due to a&mdash;hic&mdash;older
brother."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Paul's a good boy," said Grace, rather indignantly;
for, though timid, she was always ready to
rush to the defense of her favorite brother.</p>

<p>"Hey! what's that? No impudence, little chicken.
Don't you know I'm your brother, and more than
twice as old as you?"</p>

<p>Grace was about to reply, but her mother gave her
a warning glance.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p033.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">"You don't seem very glad to see me," said Stephen, scowling.</p>

<p>"You don't seem very glad to see me," said Stephen,
scowling.</p>

<p>"I should be more glad to see you if your habits
were good, Stephen," said Mrs. Palmer, gravely.</p>

<p>"Who says&mdash;hic&mdash;that my habits ain't good? Show
me the man; that's all I want. Show him to me, I
say. If it's Paul, I'll let him know who I am," said
Stephen, belligerently.</p>

<p>"I don't need any one to tell me, Stephen. Your
appearance is sufficient to show that you have been
drinking."</p>

<p>"All gentlemen drink, mother. It's good for the
health. I ain't one of your sneaking 'Sons of Temperance.'
I know how to behave, I want you to
understand. I'm a gentleman, I am."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen don't stagger when they walk, and
talk thick as you do, Stephen."</p>

<p>"You needn't lecture me any more, Mrs. Palmer&mdash;don't
you hear?" said Stephen, becoming irritated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>"When I come in of an evenin' to make a neighborly
call, you might treat me different. Have you had
supper?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I haven't. I haven't eaten a blessed thing since
mornin'."</p>

<p>"If you would like, I will get you something,
Stephen."</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk, old lady. I 'cept&mdash;hic&mdash;your
kind invitation."</p>

<p>"My mother isn't an old lady," said Grace, who
was as ready to stand up for her mother as for her
brother.</p>

<p>"My mother isn't an old lady!" repeated Stephen,
with drunken gravity. "What is she, then? She isn't
an old gentleman. Of course not."</p>

<p>"Hush, Grace!" said Mrs. Palmer. "It's of no
consequence whether I am called an old lady or
not. Would you like some tea, Stephen?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"You haven't got any whisky in the house, have
you, mother?"</p>

<p>"No; we don't keep it. Tea will be much better
for you."</p>

<p>In a few minutes a cup of tea, some cold meat, and
bread and butter were placed before Stephen, who ate
and drank with eager relish. It was true, as he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
said, that he had not broken his fast since morning,
though he had drank since then more than was good
for him.</p>

<p>His meal seemed somewhat to sober him.</p>

<p>"I say, mother," he began, pushing back his chair
from the table, "you're livin' in luxury, while I'm a
poor, miserable fellow without a home."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear it, Stephen. It is your own
fault. You are surely able to earn a comfortable living
for yourself."</p>

<p>"My health ain't good, and I can't get work half
the time."</p>

<p>It seemed very ridiculous to one who observed
his strong frame to think of him as being in poor
health.</p>

<p>"Your health would be better if you would abstain
from drink, Stephen," said Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p>"Oh, hush up! I've had enough of that talk. I'm
a gen'leman, and I'll do as I please. Mother, will you
do me a favor?"</p>

<p>"What is it, Stephen?"</p>

<p>"Lend me five dollars. I'll pay it back 'morrow
or next day&mdash;honor of a gen'leman."</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer surveyed her visitor with some indignation,
and answered, sharply:</p>

<p>"Are you not ashamed, Stephen Palmer, to ask
such a thing of me?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>"Why should I be 'shamed?"</p>

<p>"You, a strong young man, with only yourself to
support, ask me, a weak woman, dependent upon a
boy for support, to lend you money?"</p>

<p>"I'll pay it back 'morrow or next day."</p>

<p>"You know very well you would do no such thing.
You would spend it in a drunken carouse with your
disorderly companions. No, Stephen Palmer, I have
no money for you, or such as you."</p>

<p>"Is that the way you treat a son of yourn?"</p>

<p>"You are no son of mine. You are my step-son,
but your bad conduct troubled your father for years
before his death. You have no claim upon me or
mine."</p>

<p>Stephen eyed her with dull anger. Even in his
drunken condition he felt the severity of her words.</p>

<p>"I say, Mrs. Palmer, what did you do with my
father's money&mdash;the money that ought to have come
to me? You cheated me out of it, and you are livin'
in luxury, while I have no home."</p>

<p>"You know very well," said Mrs. Palmer, disdainfully,
"that your poor father left no property, except
the little furniture you see in these poor rooms. He
might have been in good circumstances had you not
involved him in losses, and reduced him to poverty by
your bad courses."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>"You've got all the money between you&mdash;you, and
Paul, and Grace," persisted Stephen, angrily.</p>

<p>"You know it's a wicked falsehood, Stephen!" said
Grace, firing up like a kitten at her step-brother's
insulting words. "You're a bad man!"</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity! I'm a bad man, am I, little vixen?"
said Stephen, glowering at her.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are!"</p>

<p>"Hush, Grace! Little girls should not talk too
much!" said her mother, fearing that Stephen might
become dangerously incensed and proceed to violence.</p>

<p>Though he was affected by drink, she felt that
she could not offer any adequate resistance in such
a case.</p>

<p>"If Paul would only come home!" she said to herself.
He was only a boy; still with him in the house
she would feel comparatively safe.</p>

<p>"Come, old lady," said Stephen, "I see you want
to get rid of me. Give me some money, and I will
begone."</p>

<p>"I have no money for you, Stephen."</p>

<p>"Didn't Paul bring home some money to-night?"</p>

<p>Paul often handed his mother the money he had
earned during the day, and would probably do so
before he went to bed, but fortunately, as she considered,
he had not yet done so.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>"He brought home money, but he has it in his
own pocket," she answered.</p>

<p>"Are you sure he didn't give it to you?" asked
Stephen, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"No, he did not."</p>

<p>"Then he ought to. He's a selfish boy, to&mdash;hic&mdash;keep
it all himself."</p>

<p>"He doesn't keep it himself. He will probably
hand it to me before he goes to bed."</p>

<p>"Then I'll come round to-morrow mornin', and
you can give me some."</p>

<p>"It will be of no use, Stephen. Paul's money
goes to support the family, and you have no claim
upon it."</p>

<p>"Haven't you any money in the house, Mrs.
Palmer?"</p>

<p>"I decline to answer the question, Stephen Palmer.
All I can say is, that I have no money for you."</p>

<p>"Come, old lady, you're puttin' on airs. I won't
have it. Do you hear me? I say I won't have it!"
and the wretched fellow pounded on the table fiercely
with his fist.</p>

<p>Just then, most unluckily, Grace started, and let the
gold piece, which she had been holding firmly in her
hand, fall on the floor.</p>

<p>Her brother espied it, and his eyes gleamed with
drunken joy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>"Ho, ho!" he said. "Gold pieces rollin' 'round!
You're mighty poor, ain't you? That's just what I
need."</p>

<p>He got up from the chair, and approaching Grace,
who by this time had picked up the gold, seized her
roughly by the arm, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Give me that gold piece, young one, or I'll wring
your neck!"</p>

<p>Grace shrank and cowered under his brutal grasp,
but still clutched the money, though pale with terror.</p>

<p>"It's mine!" she said. "You sha'n't have it."</p>

<p>"We'll see!" said the ruffian, tightening his grasp
and shaking her roughly.</p>

<small>PAUL TO THE RESCUE.</small></h2></div>


<p>Of course a contest between a burly ruffian of
twenty-five and a little girl of ten could only terminate
in one way. Stephen Palmer forcibly opened the
closed hand of his little step-sister, and snatched from
it the coveted coin, which he exultingly held aloft,
crying:</p>

<p>"I told you I would have it, you little minx."</p>

<p>Grace began to cry, and Mrs. Palmer exclaimed, in
justifiable indignation:</p>

<p>"Are you not ashamed, Stephen Palmer, to rob a
little girl like Grace?"</p>

<p>"Who talks of robbery?" retorted Stephen. "I've
only borrowed it from her."</p>

<p>He laughed tauntingly, for he understood, while he
spoke, what little chance Grace would have of recovering
her money through his voluntary restitution.</p>

<p>"Borrowed it!" repeated Mrs. Palmer, with bitter
emphasis. "It is theft, and nothing else."</p>

<p>"Do you call me a thief?" blustered Stephen,
scowling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>"You are nothing better, Stephen Palmer!" returned
his step-mother, now thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p>"Take care what you say, Mrs. Palmer!" said Stephen,
advancing a step toward her. "I'm a bad man
when I get mad."</p>

<p>"You never said a truer word," said Mrs. Palmer,
more courageous in defense of Grace than she would
have been for herself.</p>

<p>"Look here! You just drop that," said Stephen,
doggedly, "or I may do you harm."</p>

<p>"That would not be surprising," retorted the widow,
undaunted. "A man who will rob a little girl
won't hesitate to strike a woman."</p>

<p>The intoxicated young man was thoroughly incensed
by his step-mother's sarcasm, and forgot the
little manliness he ever possessed.</p>

<p>"If you think so, I'll make your words come
true," he said, savagely, and advanced toward Mrs.
Palmer with uplifted arm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer turned pale, and Grace uttered a
shriek of terror.</p>

<p>"Don't strike my mother, you bad man!" she
called out.</p>

<p>This diverted the current of Stephen's wrath, and he
turned upon the little girl.</p>

<p>"I'll whip you if you prefer it, Miss Saucebox," he
said, and grasped Grace by the shoulder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>Mrs. Palmer sprang forward to rescue her child, but
the struggle was by no means equal. The ruffian
would probably have injured both but for an opportune
arrival.</p>

<p>Paul was at the foot of the outside staircase when
he heard his little sister's scream. He had a tender
love for the little girl, and the thought that she was in
some peril gave wings to his feet. He fairly flew
up stairs, and burst into the room like a tornado.</p>

<p>One glance enabled him to understand the situation.
He seized Stephen, and forcibly wrenched him
from Grace.</p>

<p>"What does all this mean?" he demanded, turning
to his mother.</p>

<p>"It means that Stephen has stolen your sister's gold
piece, and when I remonstrated was on the point
of assaulting us both."</p>

<p>"You contemptible coward!" exclaimed Paul,
turning upon his step-brother with flashing eyes, his
manner full of disdainful contempt.</p>

<p>Even Stephen cowered a little before the boy's
scorn.</p>

<p>"I borrowed the money, that's all," he said. "It's
a great thing to make such a fuss about. And what's
more," he continued, resuming his swaggering tone,
"I won't stand any impudence from a young whelp
like you. Do you hear?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>"Grace," said Paul, not noticing the young man's
words, "has he got your gold piece now?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Grace, half crying.</p>

<p>"Give me back that money!" said Paul, sternly.</p>

<p>"Not much!" sneered Stephen. "I'll keep it if it's
only to spite you. Do you hear that?"</p>

<p>"Give me back that money!" persisted Paul, resolutely.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," answered Stephen, mockingly.
"This time next year you may call for it, and if
it's convenient I may give it up."</p>

<p>Paul opened wide the outer door, and looked out
into the street. As he looked, a policeman was just
passing.</p>

<p>"Shall I hand you over to the police?" he asked,
significantly, pointing at the guardian of the city's
peace.</p>

<p>For the first time Stephen looked uneasy.</p>

<p>"Don't try to frighten me with such nonsense," he
said. "You wouldn't dare to call him in."</p>

<p>"You'll see whether I will," said Paul, coolly.</p>

<p>Stephen looked his young step-brother full in the
face, and saw that Paul was in earnest. His bullying
had failed of its effect, and he had a decided aversion
to an encounter with the police.</p>

<p>"Take your money!" he said, flinging the gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
piece on the floor. "I only wanted to scare you
a little."</p>

<p>"Grace, you can pick up your money," said Paul.</p>

<p>"As for you, you young rascal," continued Stephen,
scowling fiercely at Paul, "I won't forget your
impertinence of to-night. I'll get even with you some
day, see if I don't."</p>

<p>"Your threats won't prevent my defending my
mother and sister against your brutal violence," said
Paul, calmly.</p>

<p>Stephen staggered out of the room, nearly tumbling
down the staircase in his drunken unsteadiness.</p>

<p>All felt relieved when he had gone.</p>

<p>"I should have lost my nice present but for you,
Paul," said Grace.</p>

<p>"I came home just in time," said Paul. "I hope
Stephen will keep away now. I never want to see
him."</p>

<p>"I never knew him to act so disgracefully before,"
said Mrs. Palmer. "He has fallen into bad habits,
and keeps disreputable company, I fear."</p>

<p>"There isn't much doubt about that, mother," said
Paul. "I have more than once seen him walking
with thieves and gamblers. Now I know where I have
seen that pickpocket before," he exclaimed, with sudden
energy.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Paul?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>"I told you about the man who jumped from the
train to-day after picking Miss Dearborn's pocket.
Well, there was something in his face that looked
familiar, but I couldn't think where I had met him,
though I was sure I had seen him before. Now I remember
meeting him walking in Randolph street with
Stephen one day last week."</p>

<p>"You don't think Stephen is a pickpocket?" asked
Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p>"No; it takes training to make a pickpocket.
Stephen isn't light-fingered enough to succeed in
any such business; but a man that keeps company
with pickpockets isn't likely to be much better than
they."</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Paul," said Mrs. Palmer, anxiously,
"that Stephen with some of his bad companions may
lie in wait for you and do you some injury."</p>

<p>"I will try to take care of myself, mother," said
Paul.</p>

<p>"Why should there be so many wicked people in
the world?" sighed the widow. "I can't see how
Stephen turned out so badly. His father was a good
man, and I have heard that he had a good mother;
but Mr. Palmer always had a great deal of trouble
with him from a boy."</p>

<p>"He is lazy, and wants to get a living without
work," answered Paul. "Then again, he drinks."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>"That alone is enough. Oh, Paul, I hope you
will never fall into intemperate habits."</p>

<p>"You need not fear for me, mother," said Paul,
firmly. "I despise drunkenness as much as anybody
can."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are very different from Stephen, Heaven
be thanked! How could I get along without you,
Paul?"</p>

<p>"I hope you won't have to get along without me,
mother. But I have been thinking that Stephen may
possibly come round here again to annoy you and
steal Grace's money. Grace, you had better let me
put the money into a savings-bank for you."</p>

<p>"That is well thought of, Paul. Then it will be
safe, even if we do have a second visit from Stephen.
What do you say, Grace?"</p>

<p>"Here it is, Paul," said the little girl. "You take
care of it for me."</p>

<p>"I will put it into a bank Saturday evening, when
some of the savings-banks are open. I don't think
Stephen will be able to get it away from me."</p>

<p>"If Stephen has any sense of shame he will not
come here again very soon," said the widow.</p>

<p>Paul went to bed early, for he must take the 7:30
train for Milwaukee in the morning. He slept
soundly, for his day's work had fatigued him.</p>

<small>BIRDS OF A FEATHER.</small></h2></div>


<p>Stephen Palmer left the residence of his step-mother
in a state of furious indignation against the
whole family, but his anger was hotter against Paul
than either of the other two members. It is rather
mortifying for a young man to find himself worsted by
a boy ten years his junior, and Stephen was obliged to
confess that he himself had come off second best.
The worst of it was, that he had lost the gold coin
which he so much coveted. He was really hard up,
his whole available funds amounting to only ten cents.
The gold piece would have been to him a real bonanza.
He had counted upon taking a cheap seat at
Hooley's Theater, and thus passing a pleasant evening,
but of course that must be given up, and there
was nothing to do but to go back to his dingy little
room, since anywhere else he would need to spend
money.</p>

<p>"Confound the boy!" ejaculated Stephen. "I'd
like to wring his neck. How dare he talk up to me as
he did? But for him," he continued, dolefully, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
would have got off with the gold. I'll get even with
him sometime, see if I don't."</p>

<p>Stephen thrust his hands deep into his pockets, and
moodily made his way to his lodging-house. It was a
shabby brick house of three stories, not far from the
lake. He had been up late the night before, and
thought he would lie down for awhile to rest. Later
in the evening, perhaps, he would go out, and might
have the good fortune to fall in with some one of
his companions who was better fixed than himself
financially.</p>

<p>He opened the door with a latch-key, and was making
his way up stairs when a little girl of twelve called
out from the back stairs in a shrill voice:</p>

<p>"Mr. Palmer, my mother wants to see you."</p>

<p>"Well, she can see me if she comes where I am,"
said Stephen, not very good-naturedly.</p>

<p>He paused on the stairs, and a woman in a faded
calico dress soon made her appearance, coming up
from below.</p>

<p>"What's wanted, Mrs. Jones?" asked Stephen, uncomfortably,
for he could guess what his landlady
wished to see him about.</p>

<p>"I'd be thankful, Mr. Palmer, if you'd pay me
your rent. You're owin' for two weeks and a half, and
I need the money very much."</p>

<p>"I can't pay you to-night," said Stephen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>"That's what you're always a-sayin'. Didn't you
promise me the money last Tuesday, when the two
weeks was up?"</p>

<p>"I've been disappointed of some money that I
expected," muttered Palmer. "If I had it I'd give it
to you."</p>

<p>"That don't pay for my groceries and fuel," said
Mrs. Jones, evidently much dissatisfied with his answer.</p>

<p>"Who said it did?"</p>

<p>"If you'll pay me some money on account," said
the landlady, beginning to understand the character
of her lodger, "I'll wait a little longer."</p>

<p>"I tell you I haven't got any money by me,
except this," and Stephen drew out the dime which
constituted his sole wealth. "I suppose you don't
want that."</p>

<p>"I'll take it on account."</p>

<p>"No, you don't. I ain't going to strip myself of
every penny to oblige a cormorant of a lodging-house
keeper."</p>

<p>"Is that all you've got to say to me, Mr. Palmer?"
asked Mrs. Jones, indignantly.</p>

<p>"What more do you want? Don't I promise to
pay you when I have the money?"</p>

<p>"Do you do any work?" demanded the landlady.
"Do you earn anything?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>"Yes."</p>

<p>"At what business?"</p>

<p>"That's my affair. However, I don't mind telling
you that I&mdash;speculate."</p>

<p>"Speculate&mdash;on ten cents!" retorted the landlady,
in a sarcastic tone.</p>

<p>"All my capital's locked up in stocks at present,"
said Stephen, with ready falsehood. "I may have five
hundred dollars coming in next week."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether to believe you or not," said
Mrs. Jones, with justifiable skepticism.</p>

<p>"Do you doubt the word of a gentleman?" blustered
Stephen.</p>

<p>"If you call yourself a gentleman, act accordin'.
I've got just one thing to say, Mr. Palmer&mdash;if you
don't pay me three weeks' lodgin' by next Tuesday,
out you go, or my name isn't Jones. I can't afford to
let my rooms to them as don't pay me."</p>

<p>"It'll be all right next Tuesday," said Stephen, glad
of the reprieve. "There's two or three parties that
owe me more than the amount of your bill, but they
don't pay up."</p>

<p>This was an utter fabrication, as there was no one in
the city or elsewhere whom Stephen could rightfully
claim as a debtor, but then a regard for truth was not
one of his strong points.</p>

<p>Stephen went up stairs to his room, and lay down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
on the bed. He soon fell asleep, and was still sleeping,
when he was aroused by a loud pounding at his
door.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" he cried out, only half awake.</p>

<p>"Come and see," was the reply, in an impatient
voice.</p>

<p>Stephen tumbled out of bed and opened the door.</p>

<p>"Luke Denton!" he said. "Why, what on earth's
the matter with you?"</p>

<p>Luke Denton it was, but by no means in as good
trim as when we first made his acquaintance in the
railroad car. There were patches of mud on his coat
and pantaloons; there was a long scratch on one
of his hands, and a bruise on his forehead, while his
nose appeared to have been bleeding. For a man
who was generally very careful of his appearance it
was certainly rather a strange plight to be in.</p>

<p>"Have you been in a fight?" Stephen asked, not
unnaturally.</p>

<p>"No, but I'd like to be in just one," growled
Denton.</p>

<p>"Who do you want to fight with?"</p>

<p>"Look here, Stephen! isn't that boy&mdash;the train
boy, I mean, on the Milwaukee road&mdash;a brother of
yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>"I can't help it&mdash;I'd like to mash him, and I will
if I get the chance."</p>

<p>"You have my permission," said Stephen, "and
I'd like to stand by and see you do it."</p>

<p>"Then there isn't much love lost between you
two?"</p>

<p>"You'd better believe there isn't. But what has he
been doing to you? You don't mean to say he is the
cause of all that?" and he pointed to Luke's disordered
dress.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is."</p>

<p>"How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"He made me jump out of the train when it was
going fifteen or twenty miles an hour."</p>

<p>"But how did he make you do it?" asked Stephen,
puzzled. "I can't understand."</p>

<p>"You see, I was sitting near a nice young lady,
who had a purse pretty well filled. I noticed it when
she took out a gold coin and gave it to the boy for his
sister."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the way Grace came by her gold,
then!"</p>

<p>"What! do you know about it?"</p>

<p>"The girl showed it to me this evening," said
Stephen. "But go on."</p>

<p>"It occurred to me that I stood more in need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of the money than she, and I managed to slip my
hand into her pocket and draw it out."</p>

<p>"I wish I could do it," said Stephen, "but I can't.
My fingers are too clumsy. I should be sure to be
caught."</p>

<p>"I would have got off well enough&mdash;in fact, I had
made up my mind to get off at Libertyville, when that
sneak of a boy came up and exposed me."</p>

<p>"Did he see you take the purse?"</p>

<p>"It seemed so. I didn't know any one was looking
when I took the money."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"The young lady jumped up in a fright. I saw my
opportunity. I had the inside seat, so I sprang for
the door, and, without much thought of the risk I ran,
made a flying leap from the train."</p>

<p>"You might have been killed. I wouldn't dare to
risk it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I wouldn't if I had had time to think;
but I didn't. Well, I landed and rolled over two or
three times, enough to get these bruises and stain my
clothes. I suppose I was lucky to escape without
breaking my neck or limbs, but I feel too sore to be
very thankful."</p>

<p>"There's a later train, starting from Libertyville.
I walked to Deerfield, and a hard time I had of it.
If the train hadn't been nearly an hour late, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
wouldn't have caught it. As it was I did, and here
I am."</p>

<p>"I suppose you didn't save the money?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I did," chuckled Luke. "Look at
this."</p>

<p>He drew out the purse, and displayed it to his
companion, whose eyes glistened as he saw the gold.</p>

<p>"How much is there?"</p>

<p>"Nearly fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"I'd be willing to be bruised a little for that
sum."</p>

<p>"I would have got it without a bruise but for that
brother of yours&mdash;dash him!"</p>

<p>"I owe him a grudge myself. I'm with you."</p>

<p>"You must hide me for a day or two till this blows
over. The police may be on my track."</p>

<p>"That depends on whether my landlady will let me
stay. She's been driving me for back rent."</p>

<p>"How much do you owe her?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks and a half at two dollars a week."</p>

<p>"Here, take that and pay her."</p>

<p>Stephen took the five-dollar gold coin which his
companion flung on the bed, but no part of it found
its way into the hands of Mrs. Jones.</p>

<small>A REJECTED SUITOR.</small></h2></div>


<p>In one of the handsomest houses on Ashland avenue
lived Grace Dearborn, the young lady whose acquaintance
Paul had made on the train. Perhaps it
would be more proper to say that her aunt, Mrs. Sheldon,
lived here, and Grace was a member of her family.
Mr. Sheldon was dead, and his widow carried on
her husband's business&mdash;a large retail drygoods store&mdash;through
the help of the former chief clerk, now promoted
to general manager, under whose wise and
faithful superintendence the store flourished, and
yielded to the widow an ample yearly income.</p>

<p>But if the aunt was wealthy so was the niece. Miss
Dearborn had come into possession of an independent
fortune of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars,
which was so invested as to net her seven per cent., or
a little more than ten thousand dollars a year.</p>

<p>As this fact was generally known, it will not be
thought strange that Miss Dearborn was much sought
after in society, and her hand was considered a great
prize in the matrimonial lottery. Thus far, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
she had resisted all solicitations, and society waited in
vain to hear of her engagement.</p>

<p>Let us go back a week, and introduce Miss Dearborn
at home on a Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>She had been chatting with her aunt on indifferent
matters, when a servant appeared with a card in the
presence of the two ladies.</p>

<p>"A gentleman to see you, Miss Grace," she said.</p>

<p>"Who is it, my dear?" asked Mrs. Sheldon, as
Grace took the card from the servant's hand.</p>

<p>"Major Ashton," answered Grace, reading from the
card.</p>

<p>"Will you see him?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I have no good excuse for declining,"
said the young lady, shrugging her shoulders.</p>

<p>"He may wish to see you on important business,"
said Mrs. Sheldon, playfully.</p>

<p>"I hope not," said the young lady, looking alarmed.
"If I thought so, I wouldn't go down."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let my words influence you, my dear.
It may be an ordinary call. Besides, if it were not,
the major is considered a desirable <i>parti</i>."</p>

<p>"Not by me," returned Grace, with emphasis.</p>

<p>"What have you to object to him? He is good-looking."</p>

<p>"Ye-es, I suppose so," admitted Grace, with evident
reluctance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>"Let me assure you, my dear Grace, that he is considered
decidedly <i>distingue</i>."</p>

<p>"I would sooner admit that than that he is <i>good-looking</i>.
He doesn't look <i>good</i> to me."</p>

<p>"What is the matter with him?"</p>

<p>"There is a look in his eyes that I don't like. It is
a cruel look, as if he had a latent fierceness and hardness
in his disposition."</p>

<p>"All fancy, Grace."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; but I don't fancy his looks."</p>

<p>"Then he is rich."</p>

<p>"I suppose he is, though I don't know."</p>

<p>"He must be. He lives like a gentleman of large
means."</p>

<p>"I don't attach much importance to wealth, aunt.
Surely, in a husband, other things are more important."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't marry a penniless lover?"</p>

<p>"Why not, if I respected and loved him?"</p>

<p>"My dear Grace, you alarm me. I never supposed
you entertained such quixotic notions. Some day we
may have you eloping with a dry-goods clerk, or a
poverty-stricken artist, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't borrow trouble, Aunt Caroline," said the
young lady, with a merry laugh. "You don't get rid
of me so easily. It is possible, of course, that I may
fulfill your prediction, for I have money enough to enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
my future husband to live respectably; but I'll
give you fair warning and sufficient notice. But I
must go down, or the major will be getting impatient."</p>

<p>Descending to the drawing-room, Grace saluted
courteously a gentleman who rose from a sofa, and
advanced to meet her with considerable <i>empressement</i>
of manner.</p>

<p>"You are very kind to consent to see me, Miss
Dearborn," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," answered Grace, smiling. "I should
have been unkind to decline, since I have no good
reason for doing so."</p>

<p>"At any rate, suffer me to interpret it as kind, since
it pleases me to do so. You do not know how much
I attach to it in the present instance."</p>

<p>A slight shade of dissatisfaction flitted over the face
of Miss Dearborn, for the words and manner of her
visitor clearly pointed to a declaration of love, which
she wished to avoid, if possible.</p>

<p>She was not like some young ladies in society, desirous
of extending the list of her conquests.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Major Ashton," she answered, lightly,
"but compliments are more in place in the ballroom."</p>

<p>"I do not mean it as a compliment, Miss Dearborn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Compliments are often insincere. I beg you
to believe that I am sincere."</p>

<p>"Don't let us make too much of a trifle, Major
Ashton. I am ready to believe you are sincere. Have
you been to the opera?"</p>

<p>There was a brief season of Italian opera in Chicago,
and this led to the question.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the major. "Might I hope that
you will accept an invitation to accompany me tomorrow
evening?" he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I must decline. I am expecting company,
or, rather, my aunt is."</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps, another evening?" suggested the
major.</p>

<p>"I fear I cannot accept during the present engagement.
You are very kind to invite me."</p>

<p>"I wish I might have the privilege of always attending
you, Miss Dearborn."</p>

<p>Grace blushed, but not with pleasure.</p>

<p>"What opera did you attend?" she inquired, coldly.</p>

<p>"'Norma.' I can't say it is my favorite, but the
parts were well sung."</p>

<p>"I have never heard it. In fact, I have to confess
that I do not enjoy the opera as much as many.
Probably my musical taste is not sufficiently developed."</p>

<p>She spoke rapidly, and somewhat nervously, hoping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
to prevent the major from carrying out what she perceived
to be his intention. But she had to do with a
man who was resolute of purpose.</p>

<p>"Miss Dearborn&mdash;Grace&mdash;" he said, abruptly, "I
hope you are not quite unprepared for what I came
here this evening to say. It consists of but three
words&mdash;<i>I love you</i>!"</p>

<p>"Of course, I am very much flattered," said Grace,
hurriedly, "but I am sorry to hear it."</p>

<p>"Why should you be sorry?"</p>

<p>"Because it is quite impossible for me to reciprocate
your feelings."</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Miss Dearborn," returned Major
Ashton, in a tone of mingled disappointment and
mortification. "Can you not learn to love me?"</p>

<p>"Love does not come by learning, or by any conscious
effort, Major Ashton. It should be spontaneous,
and come from the heart."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to be vain, or to speak egotistically,
Miss Dearborn, but I am generally considered an eligible
match. My social position you know, and I am
able to support a wife in luxury&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not care to question it," interrupted Grace.
"I hope you will transfer your flattering proposal to
some one who may prove to you a good wife, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I cannot transfer my devotion as easily as you imagine,"
said Ashton in a tone of annoyance. "I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
long loved you, and thought of you as the one woman
with whom I desired to walk through life. Your refusal,
if persisted in, will wreck my happiness."</p>

<p>Grace was tempted to survey somewhat closely the
man who thus declared that he should be miserable
without her. He did not look like a despairing lover.
His sleek black hair and whiskers, the rather insipid
regularity of his features, his evident foppish attention
to his dress, hardly indicated a soul moved to its lowest
depths by romantic and despairing passion.</p>

<p>Self-conceit, vanity, a high degree of self complacency
could be read in the major's face, but he did
not look like a man who would jump into Lake Michigan,
a victim to the tender passion.</p>

<p>Grace did not feel that there was any cause to make
herself miserable on her suitors account.</p>

<p>"I hope, Major Ashton," she replied, courteously,
"that time may soften whatever disappointment you
feel. Pardon my saying that you have never appeared
to me the one man with whom I should wish to walk
through life, and this being the case, I should wrong
both myself and you by accepting you."</p>

<p>"You will consider my proposal? You may change
your mind?"</p>

<p>"Do not hope it, Major Ashton," said Grace, firmly.
"It can never be. And now you will allow me
to bid you good-evening."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>She left the room swiftly, and Major Ashton had no
choice but to terminate his call.</p>

<p>"Confound the girl!" he muttered, when he reached
the street. "She was my trump card, and she has
failed me! What shall I do next?"</p>

<small>THE STRUGGLING ARTIST.</small></h2></div>


<p>"Here's all the illustrated papers!"</p>

<p>Of course the speaker was Paul, and again we go
back, this time four weeks.</p>

<p>It was the same afternoon train from Milwaukee,
and there were but twenty miles to travel before reaching
Chicago.</p>

<p>The conductor chanced to be making his rounds at
the same time. He was calling for the tickets in order
to punch them. Among the rest he came to a young
man, slender and graceful, and with one of those faces
that seem to win upon a stranger at first sight&mdash;a thoroughly
good face, with an expression of refinement and
intellectual power. He appeared, however, to be in
limited circumstances, for his coat was well worn, and
in places there was a suspicious shiningness indicating
a respectable antiquity.</p>


<p>"Ticket!" said the conductor, addressing himself to
the young man.</p>

<p>The young man felt in his coat-pocket for his ticket,
but it was gone&mdash;at least, he could not find it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>An expression of alarm overspread his face.</p>

<p>"I can't find my ticket," he murmured, in perplexity.</p>

<p>The conductor listened coldly, and, it must be
added, with incredulity. He had met such cases
before.</p>

<p>"Then you can pay me the value of the ticket," he
said.</p>

<p>The young man's face flushed. Small as the sum
was, he did not have it.</p>

<p>"Will you be kind enough to give me time, and I
may find the ticket?" he said.</p>

<p>"I will wait till we reach the next station," said the
official, coldly. "Then you must either show me the
ticket or pay your fare."</p>

<p>"If I can do neither?"</p>

<p>"Of course I must ask you to leave the train," and
the conductor passed on.</p>

<p>Paul stood where he could hear this colloquy, and
he noticed the distress of the young man. His sympathies
were aroused, for he suspected that the passenger
had not enough money to replace the missing
ticket.</p>

<p>He, too, knew what it was to be poor, and he pitied
him.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," he said, approaching the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
man, after the conductor had passed on, "but have
you lost your ticket?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I fear that I have."</p>

<p>"Where did you get on?"</p>

<p>"At Deerfield."</p>

<p>"That is not so bad as if it were a through ticket
from Milwaukee."</p>

<p>"No, but I am unable to replace it. I&mdash;I am not
provided with the necessary money."</p>

<p>"The ticket is less than a dollar."</p>

<p>"Yes, but even that small sum I have not at hand."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't be offended if I offer to lend
you the money," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Offended! I thank you heartily, for it is very
necessary that I reach Chicago this evening. My
mother is sick, and would be anxious."</p>

<p>Paul drew from his pocket a dollar bill, and placed
it in the young man's hand.</p>

<p>"You are very kind to a stranger. Give me your
address, that I may Send it to you."</p>

<p>Paul did so, adding:</p>

<p>"Don't put yourself to any trouble. There is no
hurry. Wait till it is convenient."</p>

<p>"Thank you again," said the young man, recovering
his cheerfulness. "I hope some time to return
the favor. I am an artist, and I will paint your portrait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
for half price, whenever you get ready to give me
a sitting."</p>

<p>"Thank you," answered Paul, laughing. "I must
wait for that till I am a little richer."</p>

<p>Frederic Vernon, for this was his name, had settled in
Chicago six months previously, with his invalid mother,
hoping to make a fair living as an artist, for he was
a clever portrait painter, but he met the usual fortune
of young men of merit who establish themselves in a
large city without influential friends. Orders came in
slowly, and he was obliged to accept paltry prices, far
below the value of his work. Yet he would not have
complained if he could have obtained enough work,
and been promptly paid for such as he did.</p>

<p>On the day subsequent to his adventure in the cars,
chance, or let us say Providence, brought him a liberal
patroness.</p>

<p>Grace Dearborn, returning from a shopping excursion,
had taken a seat in one of the city horse-cars
when her attention was attracted by the conversation
of two young ladies who were sitting near her.</p>

<p>"That's a fine portrait of yours, Sarah," said one.</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" said the other, complacently. "Pa says
it is as well painted as if we had employed a tip-top
artist."</p>

<p>"Didn't you?"</p>

<p>"No; it was painted by a young man, as poor as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
poverty, who is obliged to work for any sum people
are willing to pay. Fancy, I only paid twenty dollars."</p>

<p>"Only twenty dollars?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he wanted more, of course, and it took him
three or four weeks to paint it, but that was all I would
pay. Pa gave me fifty dollars to pay for a portrait, so
I made thirty dollars out of it," said the selfish girl,
complacently.</p>

<p>"I should think he would starve&mdash;the artist, I
mean."</p>

<p>"He did look dreadfully seedy, but that was nothing
to me, you know."</p>

<p>"I'm a great mind to get him to paint my portrait."</p>

<p>"You'd better. Let him know that you are a friend
of mine, and the price I paid, and he will paint yours
for the same."</p>

<p>"I will. What is his address?"</p>

<p>"No.&mdash;State street."</p>

<p>The other took down the address, and so did Grace.
Gifted with a warm, sympathetic nature, she could
hardly repress the disgust she felt at the miserable
selfishness of the two handsomely dressed girls, who
counted it a smart thing to obtain the services of an
accomplished artist at a price which would have poorly
compensated a hod carrier.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>"I may as well have my portrait painted," she said
to herself. "It will give me an excuse for helping
this young man, who has been so cruelly underpaid
by one who could evidently afford to pay him fairly."</p>

<p>The next morning Frederic Vernon was sitting in
his plain studio in a fit of despondency. He had just
had a visit from Miss Framley, who had given him an
order for a portrait, after beating him down to twenty
dollars.</p>

<p>In vain he had told her that he could not afford to
work so cheap. She protested that she would not pay
a cent more than her friend.</p>

<p>Vernon was on the point of declining the commission,
but he reflected with a sigh that work even at
that price was better than to be idle, and he sadly
consented.</p>

<p>Miss Framley, well pleased with the success of her
negotiation, swept out of the studio, in her seal-skin
sacque and costly silk, feeling that she would be applauded
by her father&mdash;a wholesale pork merchant&mdash;for
her financial success.</p>

<p>On the stairs, as she was descending, she met Miss
Dearborn, whom she recognized by sight, and would
have been glad to know.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Dearborn going to patronize the artist?"
she thought. "If he gets many patrons like her, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
will be getting fashionable, and put up his prices. I
am glad I have made my bargain."</p>

<p>Miss Dearborn entered the studio, and a hasty
glance satisfied her that the artist was indeed poor.
She glanced at the artist, and felt an immediate interest
in him. Though shabbily dressed, she read refinement
and nobility of character in his expressive face,
and was extremely glad she had come.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vernon, I believe," she said, gently.</p>

<p>The artist bowed.</p>

<p>"I am told you paint portraits."</p>

<p>Another bow.</p>

<p>"I will give you a commission, if you have the
time to execute it."</p>

<p>"I have something too much of that," said Vernon,
smiling faintly. "I will gladly accept your commission."</p>

<p>"If you have other work requiring your present attention,
I am not in haste."</p>

<p>"I have just agreed to paint the portrait of a Miss
Framley&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whom I met on the stairs?"</p>

<p>"Probably; she just went out."</p>

<p>"Then I will wait till you have executed her commission.
Meanwhile allow me to pay you one-half
in advance."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>Frederic Vernon stared in amazement, as she put in
his hands two fifty-dollar bills.</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars!" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you know that I have agreed to paint Miss
Framley's portrait for twenty dollars?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear it. I propose to pay a good
price for good work. There is my card. Be kind
enough to apprise me when you are ready for me."</p>

<p>"Miss Dearborn," said the artist, his face lighting
up with gratitude, "you have done a great favor to a
struggling man. Miss Framley beat me down, while
you offer to pay a price such as only an artist of established
reputation would dare to charge."</p>

<p>"I'm only anticipating matters a little," said Grace,
smiling, as she left the studio.</p>

<p>"God bless her!" ejaculated the artist, fervently.
"I was almost discouraged, but now hope lights my
pathway. I will move mother out of that dingy room
into a lighter and more cheerful apartment."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>THE FIRST SITTING.</small></h2></div>


<p>Two days later the young artist sent word to Grace
that he was ready to give her a first sitting.</p>

<p>She was not long in finding her way to the studio.</p>

<p>"You have not delayed Miss Framley on my account?"
she said.</p>

<p>"No, but Miss Framley has gone to Milwaukee for
a week, leaving me at leisure."</p>

<p>When Grace, following directions, had seated herself
in the required attitude, Vernon engaged her in
conversation about books and authors, and each discovered
that the other had a mind rarely cultivated.</p>

<p>Miss Dearborn's face lighted up, and became animated.
She forgot that she was sitting for her portrait,
and for that very reason, perhaps, afforded a better
study for the young artist. He could not help,
from time to time, directing glances of scarcely disguised
admiration at the fair sitter. But of this she
was unconscious.</p>

<p>When the sitting closed, she was surprised to learn
that she had been in the studio two hours.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>"I hope you have not found it very tedious," said
Vernon, apologetically.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," answered Grace, smiling. "The
time has passed quickly."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that. Then you won't mind giving
another sitting soon?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, if you like."</p>

<p>"I should like it exceedingly, if it will not interfere
with your engagements."</p>

<p>"Oh, my engagements are those of an idle young
lady, and can easily be put off. May I see what progress
you have made?"</p>

<p>"I would rather you would not look just yet. I
have only made a beginning."</p>

<p>"I will be patient, then. Indeed, I can't say I am
over anxious. My own face is quite familiar enough
to me."</p>

<p>"If I can make it look natural, I shall be quite
contented."</p>

<p>"I have confidence in your talent. Besides, I have
heard one of your portraits highly praised."</p>

<p>"Indeed! May I ask where?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you. It is a friend of Miss Framley."</p>

<p>"Miss Cutler?"</p>

<p>"Very likely. I don't know either of the young
ladies, but I overheard them in a street-car commending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
highly the portrait you had painted of Miss Cutler.
They seemed equally pleased," she added with
a smile, "with the low price which you asked for your
work."</p>

<p>"Which she compelled me to accept, rather," said
Vernon, with a curl of the lip. "I should starve if
all my patrons were as bent upon a good bargain."</p>

<p>"Mr. Vernon," said Grace, earnestly, "I don't
think you will have to paint another portrait at such
a ridiculously low price."</p>

<p>"Not if all were as generously disposed as you," returned
Vernon, gratefully.</p>

<p>"There may be others disposed to pay you a fair
price. Indeed, I have persuaded my aunt to sit to
you when my portrait is finished."</p>

<p>"How can I thank you for your kindness, Miss
Dearborn?"</p>

<p>"No thanks are required where an equivalent service
is rendered."</p>

<p>Frederic Vernon was elated by this second order,
for he judged that the compensation would be equally
liberal.</p>

<p>This was the case, for it was Grace who paid for her
aunt's portrait. Mrs. Sheldon at first objected to sitting
till her niece assured her that she wished the portrait
for her own room, and wished the privilege of
paying for it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>"But, my dear, it will be so tedious sitting in the
young man's studio for an hour or two at a time."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear aunt, I won't force you to do it
alone. I will accompany you."</p>

<p>"If you will, Grace, I shall not mind it so much.
I am afraid you will find it stupid."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I think not. I can carry a magazine or
novel, you know."</p>

<p>"To be sure."</p>

<p>Grace did carry some reading matter, but made little
progress in it.</p>

<p>She and Vernon always found something to talk
about, and sometimes her aunt joined in, when the
subject was not above her comprehension.</p>

<p>She, too, approved the artist.</p>

<p>"Really, my dear," she said, "the young man
seems very intelligent, and, indeed, <i>distingue</i>, if his
clothes were better."</p>

<p>"Artists cannot dress handsomely at their work,
Aunt Caroline."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not. Still, I fancy Mr. Vernon is
poor. He has a very plain studio."</p>

<p>"He hopes to get into a better one soon, he tells
me."</p>

<p>"He looks as if he had seen better days," said Mrs.
Sheldon, reflectively. "I've a great mind to ask him."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>"Oh, pray don't, Aunt Caroline!" said Grace, in
alarm.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"He may be sensitive on the subject. It may
arouse painful thoughts."</p>

<p>"Possibly; then I won't speak of it."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't, if I were you."</p>

<p>When Grace's portrait was sent home, she took
pains to show it to her friends in the hope that she
might procure additional work for the young artist.
She was successful, and before Mrs. Sheldon's was
completed, Mr. Vernon had received three orders
from friends of the heiress, one a gentleman, who
felt safe in patronizing one whom Miss Dearborn
spoke well of.</p>

<p>With considerable diffidence, on the recommendation
of Grace, Vernon ventured to charge the same
sum&mdash;two hundred dollars&mdash;and was surprised to find
that his new patrons more readily agreed to pay this
sum than the very modest price he had formerly asked.
They took it for granted that a man who demanded
such prices must be an artist of high rank, and agreed
to his terms without a word.</p>

<p>The fact that he had felt justified in taking a more
commodious and spacious studio, and had purchased
a new suit, helped him, for most people judge by appearances.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>Before he left the old studio, however, he had a call
from a friend of Miss Framley and Miss Cutler, who
ignorant of the favorable turn in his affairs, expected
to obtain his work on equally favorable terms.</p>

<p>Frederic Vernon was alone when the young lady&mdash;Miss
Henrietta Simmons&mdash;came sailing in, rustling in
silk, and modeled after the latest fashion plate.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vernon, I suppose?" she said, condescendingly.</p>

<p>"The same, miss."</p>

<p>"Two of my friends, Miss Cutler and Miss Framley,
have sat to you for their portraits."</p>

<p>The artist bowed.</p>

<p>"Really, you succeeded very well in both," said the
young lady, patronizingly.</p>

<p>"Thank you for saying so."</p>

<p>"I have about made up my mind to employ you."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to accept your commission."</p>

<p>"I suppose the terms will be the same," said the
young lady, carelessly.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not."</p>

<p>"Miss Framley told me you wouldn't charge me
any more than she paid."</p>

<p>"Miss Framley is in error."</p>

<p>"I might be willing to pay you twenty-five dollars,"
said the young lady, disappointed, "though I felt sure
you would charge me no more than my friends."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>"I am charging two hundred dollars now for portraits,"
said the young artist, gravely.</p>

<p>"Two hundred dollars!" ejaculated the visitor.
"Surely, no one would pay you that."</p>

<p>"I have three orders on hand, each of which will
pay me that sum."</p>

<p>"I can't understand it," said Miss Simmons, bewildered.</p>

<p>"I believe the quality of my work is getting known
and appreciated," said Vernon, smiling at the young
lady's amazement. "Your friends were fortunate
enough to employ me when I was wholly unknown."</p>

<p>Some months after&mdash;to anticipate a little&mdash;when
Vernon had become a fashionable portrait painter,
Miss Simmons actually sat to him, and paid his
price.</p>

<p>It is the way of the world. We are willing to pay
any sum at the bidding of Fashion, with little regard
to what we pay for.</p>

<p>But while Vernon's worldly success had improved,
there was another consequence of his acquaintance
with Grace which disquieted him. In spite of all the
arguments which reason could offer, he felt that he
was drifting&mdash;had already drifted&mdash;into love for the
beautiful girl to whose kindness of heart he owed his
new prosperity.</p>

<small>MISS FRAMLEY'S ECONOMY.</small></h2></div>


<p>Three days passed, and nothing more had been
seen of Stephen Palmer in his step-mother's humble
home.</p>

<p>"I hope he'll keep away," said Paul. "His coming
can do no good, and gives no pleasure to any
of us."</p>

<p>"I agree with you, Paul, though it seems hard
to say that of one of the family."</p>

<p>"He has never behaved like one of the family,"
said Paul.</p>

<p>"He was a wayward boy, and even at an early
age gave considerable trouble to his father and myself."</p>

<p>"He hasn't improved as he has grown older,
mother."</p>

<p>"I am glad you are not like him, Paul."</p>

<p>"Then I am not altogether a nuisance," said Paul,
laughingly.</p>

<p>"You are my main support&mdash;the staff on which
I lean, my dear son. You have always been a good
boy."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>"The staff will be stronger some day, mother,"
said Paul, cheerfully. "I am not always going to
have you spoil your eyes by sewing."</p>

<p>"I feel better to be doing something. That reminds
me&mdash;I have just finished some work for Miss
Framley. Do you think you can carry it after supper?"</p>

<p>This conversation took place at the tea-table.</p>

<p>"Certainly, mother; you know I always go out for
a walk, and I can just as well go to Mr. Framley's as
anywhere else. How much am I to collect on it?"</p>

<p>"A dollar and a half, I think, won't be too much.
It has taken me four days."</p>

<p>"You ought to charge more, mother. Think of a
dollar and a half for four days' work! Why, it won't
half pay you," said Paul, indignantly.</p>

<p>"I don't dare charge more, Paul, or the Framleys
will give me no more work. I was recommended
to her by her friend, Miss Cutler, as one who would
work cheap, and in the only interview I had with
her she impressed this upon me as a matter of great
importance."</p>

<p>"Is she poor? Does she need to grind you down
to such low prices?"</p>

<p>"No; she lives in an elegant house on Wabash
avenue, and she is always dressed in the most costly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
style. No doubt she has plenty of money at command."</p>

<p>"Then she can't be a lady," said Paul, decidedly.</p>

<p>"She certainly thinks herself so," said Mrs. Palmer.
"Her father is a man once poor, and still uneducated,
who made a good deal of money during the
war, and is now ambitious to live in style."</p>

<p>"Shoddy!" said Paul, contemptuously. "That explains
it."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless I am glad to obtain work from them,
Paul."</p>

<p>"Provided they will pay a reasonable price. You
had better let me charge two dollars, mother."</p>

<p>"No, it will not do. I shall be satisfied with a dollar
and a half."</p>

<p>"Very well, mother. Of course it is for you to
decide."</p>

<p>Paul finished his supper, and, taking the bundle,
made his way&mdash;partly by walking, partly by riding&mdash;to
Wabash avenue.</p>

<p>The houses on this avenue were handsome, and
looked like the abodes of luxury.</p>

<p>"I wish mother could live here," said Paul to himself.
"It makes me discontented with our poor home,
after seeing so much elegance."</p>

<p>At last he reached the house of Mr. Framley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
whose daughter has already made her appearance in
our story as the economical patron of art.</p>

<p>Paul ascended the steps and rang the bell.</p>

<p>The summons was answered by a man-servant, who
surveyed Paul with an air of lofty superiority.</p>

<p>"Well, young feller," he said, "what have you got
there?"</p>

<p>"A bundle of work for Miss Framley, old feller!"
answered Paul.</p>

<p>"Was you addressin' me?" demanded the flunkey,
angrily.</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"I am not an old feller."</p>

<p>"Young feller, then, if you like it better."</p>

<p>"You are an impertinent boy."</p>

<p>"I have no business with you," said Paul, coolly.
"Take that bundle to your mistress, if you please,
and say to her that the bill is one dollar and a half."</p>

<p>"You can call for the money some other time,"
and the servant was about to close the door, when
Paul said, sharply:</p>

<p>"That won't do, I can't come here twice. Tell
Miss Framley what I said."</p>

<p>The servant retired, grumbling, and soon returned
with a dollar bill, which he offered to Paul.</p>

<p>"Miss Framley says the work isn't extra well done,
and a dollar's enough. You can take it and go."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>Paul's eyes flashed with justifiable indignation.</p>

<p>"I should like to see Miss Framley," he said.
"This won't do."</p>

<p>"She won't see you. Better take the money and
go."</p>

<p>"I will take the money&mdash;on account, but not in
full payment. I wish to see Miss Framley."</p>

<p>That young lady was listening at the head of the
stairs, being desirous of hearing whether the messenger
made any fuss about her mean reduction of a reasonable
price, and thought it best to descend the
stairs and argue the matter.</p>

<p>"Are you the son of Mrs. Palmer?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Framley."</p>

<p>"Then tell your mother she asks too much for her
work. A dollar is quite enough for the little she
did."</p>

<p>"Do you know how long she was occupied with
your work?" said Paul.</p>

<p>"No; I suppose she did it in a day or two,"
answered the young lady, in a tone of indifference.</p>

<p>"It occupied four days, and you wish to pay her at
the rate of twenty-five cents per day."</p>

<p>"Really, it is nothing to me if your mother is a
slow worker. I oughtn't to suffer for that."</p>

<p>"Wasn't the work well done?"</p>

<p>"Tolerably well."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>"My mother is noted for her excellent work, Miss
Framley. She is entitled to one dollar and a half for
this piece of work, and that isn't enough. If she had
taken my advice, she would have charged you two
dollars."</p>

<p>"Really, you are a very presuming boy," said Miss
Framley. "My friend, Miss Cutler, told me your
mother would work cheap, and so I employed her.
If she is contented with a dollar, I will send her some
more work."</p>

<p>"She will not be contented with a dollar," said
Paul, firmly. "I insist upon the price named."</p>

<p>Miss Framley drew out her purse, and, taking a
half-dollar from it, with a spiteful air handed it to our
hero.</p>

<p>"There," she said, "take it, but don't expect me
to employ your mother again."</p>

<p>"I don't," said Paul. "Good-evening."</p>

<p>"It is absolute extortion," said the economical
young lady, as she went up stairs again. "It is very
provoking, for Mrs. Palmer sews exquisitely. If I
hold off for awhile, I may bring her to my terms.
Twenty-five cents a day is a very fair price for such
easy work as sewing, <i>in my opinion</i>."</p>

<p>"Well," thought Paul, as he bent his steps homeward,
"there are certainly some mean people in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
world. Evidently Miss Framley is rich, but I wouldn't
be as mean as she for all her money."</p>

<p>He wasn't far from home when, in passing one
of the brilliantly lighted stores on Clark street, his
attention was drawn to a young lady just descending
from a carriage. As the light fell upon her face,
he recognized his traveling acquaintance of a few days
before.</p>

<p>"Miss Dearborn!" he cried, hastening forward with
a pleasant smile of recognition.</p>

<p>Grace turned.</p>

<p>"Why, it is my friend of the train!" she said, cordially.
"Aunt Caroline"&mdash;for Mrs. Sheldon was just
behind her&mdash;"this is Paul Palmer, who tried to save
my purse from the pickpocket."</p>

<p>"It is a pity he had not succeeded, Grace. I presume
the unprincipled man has spent most of it by
this time."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Grace, with a laugh. "Well,
Paul, have you met with any more adventures, or rescued
any more young ladies from the schemes of dangerous
men?"</p>

<p>"I have not had a chance, Miss Dearborn."</p>

<p>"But I don't doubt you would be ready. How is
my namesake?"</p>

<p>"She is very well. She was delighted with your
present."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>"I am glad of that. Can you spare five minutes,
or are you in a hurry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I have plenty of time."</p>

<p>"Then come into this store with me."</p>

<p>Paul followed Grace, wondering a little why she
made the request. When he came out he carried in
his hand a very pretty child's cloak which Miss Dearborn
had purchased.</p>

<p>"Give it to your little sister, with my love," she
said.</p>

<p>"How generous you are, Miss Dearborn! Grace
won't be able to sleep tonight for joy."</p>

<p>"Be sure you remember your promise to bring her
around to see me."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Will the evening do? I am on the
train during the day."</p>

<p>"Come next Thursday evening&mdash;I will expect
you."</p>

<p>"There is some difference between Miss Dearborn
and Miss Framley," thought Paul.</p>

<small>PAUL GETS INTO TROUBLE.</small></h2></div>


<p>With a glad heart, notwithstanding the loss of Miss
Framley's patronage, Paul bent his steps toward his
humble home.</p>

<p>Grace was still up, not being willing to go to bed
till her brother came home.</p>

<p>"What is there in that bundle, Paul?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You have not brought the work back, Paul?"
asked his mother, apprehensively, for it would have
been a serious thing to spend more time on it, when
her time was so poorly paid for.</p>

<p>"No," answered Paul; "I left the work."</p>

<p>"Was Miss Framley at home? Did you collect the
money?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I had some difficulty about it. Do you
think, she was mean enough to try to turn me off with
a dollar."</p>

<p>"A dollar for four days' work! How can the rich
be so inconsiderate?" sighed Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p>"Inconsiderate!" exclaimed Paul, indignantly.
"That isn't the word&mdash;it's downright meanness."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>"Wouldn't she pay you the dollar and a half?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I insisted on it. I gave her a piece of my
mind."</p>

<p>"I hope you didn't make her angry, Paul. She
won't give me any more work."</p>

<p>"No, she won't; but you mustn't mind that. I'll
find some one that will pay you better. Here is the
money, mother."</p>

<p>The widow took the three half-dollars which were
handed her, with a sigh. In spite of Paul's confident
assurance, she felt disappointed at having lost Miss
Framley's custom. She was not so hopeful as she had
been at Paul's age, having met with her share of the
world's rebuffs.</p>

<p>"You haven't told me what you've got in that
bundle, Paul," said Grace, returning to the charge.</p>

<p>"I'll show you, Miss Curiosity," said Paul, and
proceeded to open it.</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed Grace, spell-bound
with rapturous admiration as the beautiful little cloak
was held up before her.</p>

<p>"It's for me," said Paul, gravely. "How does it
fit?" and he threw it over his shoulders and walked
about, the little cloak barely descending to his waist.</p>

<p>"It doesn't fit you at all, Paul. Isn't it for me?"</p>

<p>"For you? Who would buy such a nice cloak for
you, do you think?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>"I am afraid you have been very extravagant, Paul,"
said his mother. "The cloak is very pretty, but we
cannot afford such things."</p>

<p>"It didn't cost me a cent, mother."</p>

<p>"Then who gave it to you? Not Miss Framley?"</p>

<p>"I should say not," answered Paul, contemptuously.
"Catch her giving five cents' worth to anybody! No;
it was Miss Grace Dearborn, the same young lady that
sent Grace the gold piece."</p>

<p>"Where did you see her? Did you call at the
house?"</p>

<p>So Paul had to tell the story, which does not require
repeating, and Grace tried on the cloak, which proved
to be an excellent fit, though it hardly harmonized
with the child's plain print dress.</p>

<p>"Some time I'll buy you a new dress, Grace," said
her brother, "a dress that you can wear with the cloak.
I wish you had it by next Thursday evening."</p>

<p>"Why then, Paul?" asked his mother.</p>

<p>"Because I have promised to take Grace with me
to see Miss Dearborn on that evening."</p>

<p>The pleasure excited by the gift was such that Mrs.
Palmer was unusually jubilant, notwithstanding the loss
of one of her customers. She did not seem wholly forsaken,
and fortune appeared again to have smiled
upon her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though Paul did not know it, trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
was preparing for him. He had two enemies&mdash;one his
own brother, Stephen, already introduced; the other
Luke Denton, whose designs he had frustrated in the
car. Luke had not forgiven him for the leap which he
was obliged to make from the moving train, and the
bruises which he received in consequence.</p>

<p>"I'll be even with the young sneak&mdash;see if I don't,"
said Luke, vengefully, to Stephen, as they sat together
in the room of the latter, smoking.</p>

<p>"Don't blame you a bit," said Stephen.</p>

<p>"I can't help it if he is your brother," continued
Luke. "He's injured me, and I'll make him suffer
for it."</p>

<p>"You needn't think I'm going to stand up for him,"
said Stephen; "I hate him myself. Didn't he prevent
me from&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Robbing your little sister," said Luke, finishing
out the sentence.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to rob her," said Stephen, half-angrily.
"I needed the money, and was only goin' to
borrow it for a day or two."</p>

<p>Luke Denton laughed. He did not admire Stephen,
though he kept his company, and felt a malicious
pleasure in saying disagreeable things.</p>

<p>"Of course; that's understood," he said. "You'd
have gone round and returned the loan, with interest;
that's the way you always do."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>"I don't like your way of talkin', Luke," said
Stephen, frowning. "You may not mean anything;
but I don't like it."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind that. The main thing is&mdash;we
both hate that impertinent stripling, and you won't
feel very bad if he gets into a scrape, even if you are
his brother."</p>

<p>"No; I shall be glad of it."</p>

<p>"Then I reckon you'll have a chance to be glad
very soon."</p>

<p>"How is that? Is there anything in the wind?"</p>

<p>Luke nodded, and in a few sentences detailed a plan
which he had devised during the time his physical injuries
had obliged him to remain in the retirement of
his friend's room.</p>

<p>Stephen laughed approvingly.</p>

<p>"Good!" he said. "Couldn't be better! Good
enough for the pious little fraud! After that, he won't
lecture me so much&mdash;me, his elder brother! I wonder
I haven't wrung his neck before now."</p>

<p>"He might resist, you know," said Luke, dryly.</p>

<p>"Do you think I ain't a match for the little cur?"
blustered Stephen.</p>

<p>"I think he might give you more trouble than you
think for. He's strong and muscular for a boy of his
age, and he isn't a coward. I'll give him credit for so
much."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>This led to more boasts on the part of Stephen, to
which his companion listened, with an amused smile.
He despised Stephen, who was far inferior to himself
in education and manners; for Luke was fitted for a
better career than he had been led to adopt.</p>

<p>The next afternoon Paul was returning to Chicago
by the usual train. He had met with fair success in
selling his papers and books; indeed with rather more
than the average, having sold three bound novels,
which sale afforded him a handsome profit.</p>

<p>In passing through the cars, his attention had been
turned more than once to an old man, with a long
gray beard and hair of the same color, who was dressed
in rather an old-fashioned suit. Experience had taught
him that men of that appearance are seldom likely to
buy anything more than a daily paper, and he had not
left any circulars with the old Quaker, for such his
broad-brimmed hat showed him to be.</p>

<p>"Come here, boy!" called the old gentleman, as
he was passing the second time. "What has thee to
sell?"</p>

<p>"All the illustrated papers and magazines," answered
Paul. "I have besides some novels, if you
want to look at them."</p>

<p>"Nay, my young friend; life is too brief to read
such light books. Has thee the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; here it is."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>The old man took it, and began gravely to turn over
the pages.</p>

<p>"What does thee ask for it?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Thirty-five cents."</p>

<p>"My wife Ruth likes to read it. I think I will purchase
it," said the old man.</p>

<p>So saying, he put his hand into his pocket to feel for
his wallet.</p>

<p>Quickly an expression of alarm came over his face,
and he exclaimed, loud enough to be heard by all the
passengers near by:</p>

<p>"I have been robbed! I cannot find my wallet!"</p>

<p>"It may have dropped out of your pocket," suggested
Paul.</p>

<p>"Nay, I see it. It is in thy pocket, thou young
thief!" exclaimed the old man, reaching out his hand
and drawing forth a large wallet from the side pocket
of Paul's sack coat. "It is truly sad to see such depravity
in one so young."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say I took your wallet?" asked
Paul, thunderstruck.</p>

<p>"It cannot be otherwise. Did I not find it in thy
pocket? Is there an officer present? This boy should
be arrested."</p>

<p>"I am a detective," said a man near by, showing
his badge.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>"Then it is thy duty to arrest the boy. He is a
thief!"</p>

<p>Poor Paul! Brave as he was, his heart sank as he
saw the passengers regarding him with suspicion.</p>

<p>"I am innocent," he said. "I never stole in my
life."</p>

<p>"So young and so hardened!" said the old man,
sorrowfully; and Paul saw that his denial was not
credited.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>PAUL'S CRITICAL POSITION.</small></h2></div>


<p>Paul felt that he was in a tight place. He could
not understand how the wallet could have got into his
pocket. Yet there it was, and appearances were decidedly
against him in spite of his innocence.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p095.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">"I did not steal the wallet," Paul said firmly.</p>

<p>"I did not steal the wallet," he said, firmly.</p>

<p>"Then how came it in thy pocket?" asked the old
man.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Some one must have put it
there."</p>

<p>"Verily that is a poor excuse," said the aged
Quaker.</p>

<p>"It's too thin!" said a young man near by, who
thought himself a wit. "It won't wash!"</p>

<p>Paul looked at him in disdain. Still it troubled
him, because he feared the other passengers would
agree with the speaker.</p>

<p>Just then the conductor entered the car. He was a
firm friend of Paul, whom he had known ever since
he first came on board the train.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked the conductor, looking
with surprise at the group around Paul.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>"A pocket-book has been stolen, I believe," said a
quiet passenger.</p>

<p>The conductor walked up to the scene of excitement.</p>

<p>Paul looked up at him with a feeling of relief.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bates," he said, "do you think I would
steal?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Paul. Who charges you with it?"</p>

<p>"This gentleman here," answered our hero, pointing
to the Quaker.</p>

<p>"I fear thee is guilty, for I discovered my wallet in
thy pocket," said the Quaker, mildly.</p>

<p>"Is this true, Paul?" asked the conductor, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Can you explain it?"</p>

<p>"No. This gentleman asked me for a magazine,
and, on looking for his money, could not find his
pocket-book."</p>

<p>"I looked in thy pocket, and straightway found it,"
supplemented the Quaker.</p>

<p>"What made you look there?" asked the conductor.</p>

<p>"I thought the boy might have yielded to a sudden
temptation. It grieves me to think he was so
weak."</p>

<p>The detective here spoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>"Conductor," said he, "do you know this boy
well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Has any charge ever been made against him
before?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Has he ever been suspected of dishonesty to your
knowledge?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. He is the most popular train boy
we ever had. I would stake a years salary on his
honesty."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Bates," said Paul, gratefully.</p>

<p>He felt gratified, in this trying emergency, to find
that there was one man who had full confidence in
him.</p>

<p>"He looks honest," said the detective, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Verily, appearances are deceitful," said the Quaker.
"I cannot afford to lose my money because the
boy looks honest. Was not the wallet found in his
pocket? I call upon thee, officer, to arrest him."</p>

<p>Paul felt very uncomfortable. Though he was
buoyed up by the consciousness of his innocence,
he was troubled by the thought that he might be
carried back to Chicago handcuffed, or at any rate
under arrest. Suppose he should meet some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
whom he knew, would it not always be remembered
against him, even if he were acquitted?</p>

<p>"You wish to press the charge, then?" said the
detective.</p>

<p>"Verily, it is my duty."</p>

<p>"I hope, sir," said Paul, "you will not injure me
to that extent. I swear to you that I am innocent."</p>

<p>"Probably thee art equally regardless of honesty
and the truth."</p>

<p>"Will you be prepared to appear in court upon the
charge to-morrow morning?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>"Yes, verily," answered the Quaker, with a little
hesitation.</p>

<p>"Do you live in Chicago?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I live in Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"Of course, all the broadbrims come from Philadelphia,"
said the witty young man. "Yea, verily,
they do."</p>

<p>"Friend, do not deride me," said the old Quaker,
looking rebukingly at the speaker.</p>

<p>"What is your name, sir?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"My name is Ephraim Perry," answered the old
man.</p>

<p>"Where are you staying in Chicago?"</p>

<p>"At the Commercial Hotel."</p>

<p>"Shall you be there to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p>"Yea, verily."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>"It strikes me," thought the detective, who was
himself a native of Philadelphia, "he rather overdoes
the 'yea, verily.' I have lived in Philadelphia, and I
never heard any of the 'Friends' use the expression so
freely."</p>

<p>"How do you identify the wallet?" he asked,
aloud. "How do you know it is yours?"</p>

<p>"By the appearance."</p>

<p>"Appearances are deceitful, as you said a little
while ago. Can you tell me what are the contents?"</p>

<p>So saying, the detective, to whom the wallet had
been passed, made a motion to open the wallet.</p>

<p>"I trust thee will not open the wallet," said the
Quaker, hastily.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It contains private papers."</p>

<p>"Such as what? It is necessary that I should satisfy
myself that the wallet is really yours."</p>

<p>"Will thee not take my word?" asked the Quaker,
uneasily.</p>

<p>"Will you swear that the pocket-book is yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Nay, I never swear," said the Quaker, hastily
interrupting himself. "I will affirm."</p>

<p>"I am ready to swear that I didn't take the wallet,"
said Paul.</p>

<p>"That is different," said the Quaker. "Will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
that be satisfactory?" asked the Quaker, turning to the
detective.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Does thee doubt my word?" asked the old man,
reproachfully, and seeming very uneasy.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily, but I think you may be mistaken,"
answered the detective, composedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, open the wallet," said the conductor, who,
as Paul's friend, was led to hope that the result of the
search might, somehow or other, turn out for Paul's
advantage.</p>

<p>"Thee shall not do it!" exclaimed the old Quaker,
in excitement. "It is my property, and no one shall
open it."</p>

<p>He thrust out his hand and tried to clutch it, but
the detective held it above his head.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand your reluctance," he said.
"Is there anything in it that you are anxious to
conceal?"</p>

<p>"Nay," answered the Quaker, faintly; "but it is
my property."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what is in it?"</p>

<p>The old man was silent.</p>

<p>"Then I will open it."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed the detective, drawing out two
pieces of pasteboard. "Here are two pool tickets;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and here," drawing out another paper, "is a lottery
ticket. Do Quakers deal in such articles?"</p>

<p>"Some evil-disposed person must have put them
there," said the old man, nervously, "The boy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The boy had no chance. Come, sir, I believe you
are masquerading. Let me see. Here is a card&mdash;Luke
Denton. Ha! I begin to see what it all
means."</p>

<p>With a quick and unsuspected movement, the detective
grasped the hat of the pretended Quaker, and
next seized his wig, which came off readily in his
hands, displaying to the gaze of the astonished passengers
the dark hair and the face of a man of thirty-five,
instead of an old man of over sixty.</p>

<p>"The pickpocket that jumped from the train!" exclaimed
Paul, in excitement.</p>

<p>"I recognize him now," said the conductor. "This
is clearly a plot to get you into trouble."</p>

<p>"Yea, verily," chimed in the witty young man.</p>

<p>"I'll clip your feathers some time, young man!"
said Denton, scowling at the speaker.</p>

<p>"My Quaker friend," said the detective, "you are
wanted for that little affair on the cars the other day."</p>

<p>He produced a pair of handcuffs. Luke Denton
struggled vigorously, but the conductor assisted, and
his hands were soon securely fastened.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Paul," said the conductor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
"It was a mean plot, and might have succeeded. But
I never doubted you."</p>

<p>"I know you didn't, Mr. Bates. I shall never forget
that," said Paul, gratefully.</p>

<p>"I came near succeeding," said Denton, grimly.
"The next time I will wholly succeed."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," rejoined the detective. "Your disguise
was very good, Mr. Denton; but there was one
thing you forgot."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"To wear gloves. Any one would know that the
hands did not belong to an old man. Besides, Quakers
don't generally wear rings. I suspected you from
the first."</p>

<p>"What a consummate fool I was!" muttered Denton,
in disgust. "I ought to have thought of that."</p>

<small>GRACE DEARBORN AT HOME.</small></h2></div>


<p>Grace Dearborn sat before the fire in her aunt's
handsome house, with a writing-desk in her lap. Before
her was a sheet of note-paper on which she had
commenced writing a list of names.</p>

<p>Her aunt sat near her, dictating a list of persons
who were to receive cards of invitation to a party
which she proposed giving in honor of her niece's
birthday.</p>

<p>Grace had been writing busily for some time.</p>

<p>"Any one else, Aunt Caroline?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I believe I have included every one. Let me
think. Oh, I came near forgetting Major Ashton.
How stupid of me!"</p>

<p>"Major Ashton," repeated Grace, as she wrote the
name.</p>

<p>"It would have been singular if we had forgotten
to include him," said the elder lady.</p>

<p>"I did not forget him," returned Grace.</p>

<p>"Then why did you not remind me?"</p>

<p>"I suppose because I was not very anxious to have
him invited."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>"Yet he did you the honor of offering you his
hand?"</p>

<p>"He may have considered it an honor; I didn't,"
said Grace, decidedly.</p>

<p>"At all events it was a compliment."</p>

<p>"Be it so! If he would accept his rejection as final
I should not mind, but on the two or three occasions
since when we have met he has tried to introduce the
subject again. He does not seem willing to take no
for an answer."</p>

<p>"Why not reconsider the matter, Grace? He is
rich&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As if I cared for that."</p>

<p>"Well, he is fashionable, and is met everywhere
in society. He would give his wife a desirable position."</p>

<p>"Will that compensate for the lack of love, Aunt
Caroline?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but love would come in time."</p>

<p>"Love must come <i>before</i> marriage in my case, Aunt
Caroline. With Major Ashton it would never come
afterward."</p>

<p>"You speak very decidedly, Grace."</p>

<p>"No more so than I feel. To be quite frank with
you, I am more than indifferent to Major Ashton. I
positively dislike him."</p>

<p>"Why? Can you assign any reason?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>"None that will fully explain my feelings. The
fact is, I cannot myself account for the antipathy
with which he inspires me. It seems almost instinctive.
Without knowing anything against him
I feel convinced that he is a bad and dangerous
man."</p>

<p>"This is silly, Grace."</p>

<p>"It may be so, but I can't help it."</p>

<p>"You do not object to my inviting him to your
party?"</p>

<p>"No. I have no right to do that, or rather I do
not wish to; since it would be a gratuitous slight. He
must come, of course, though I would rather he were
away."</p>

<p>"That is all, then, unless any other name occurs to
you."</p>

<p>"There is one other name, Aunt Caroline," said
Grace, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Vernon."</p>

<p>"What Mr. Vernon?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Frederic Vernon, the artist."</p>

<p>"But, Grace, he is not in society. He does not belong
to our circle."</p>

<p>"He is a gentleman, Aunt Caroline, and is worthy
of social recognition."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>"My dear child, he is very poor. I doubt whether
he has a dress suit to appear in."</p>

<p>"That is his affair. He may not come, but it will
be polite in us to invite him."</p>

<p>"You are rather quixotic, Grace."</p>

<p>"Why do you think so? I know Mr. Vernon to
be well educated, and possessed of culture and refinement
in a higher degree than many of the gentlemen
who will receive invitations. I feel like
recognizing him as an equal. Do you seriously
object?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Send him a card if you wish. I only
wished to set before you the singularity of inviting a
poor, obscure artist to a fashionable party. We may
be criticised."</p>

<p>"We propose to please ourselves, not the critics,
Aunt Caroline," answered Grace, with a curl of the
lip. "Now, there is one on your list whom I think
much more unfit than Mr. Vernon, who is qualified to
appear anywhere among gentlemen and ladies."</p>

<p>"To whom do you refer, Grace?"</p>

<p>"To Miss Framley."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything against her? She was recently
introduced to me at a party, and made herself
very agreeable. I could not very well help sending
her a card."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>"I know she is vulgar, and mean in money matters.
Before I ever met her I got an insight into
her character from a chance conversation which I
overheard between herself and a friend in a street
car."</p>

<p>"She visits at good houses."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I believe her father is rich, and I know
they live in handsome style, but that doesn't save her
from being vulgar and ill-bred."</p>

<p>"You are disposed to be too critical, Grace. It
won't do to judge our fashionable acquaintances too
rigidly. We must take the world as we find it."</p>

<p>"Smiling on those who are prosperous, and frowning
on those who are not wealthy. We must, in other
words, apply the standard of gold to all."</p>

<p>"No; that is overstating it. But if we find persons
in good society we may feel safe in associating with
them; then, if we prove mistaken, we can throw the
responsibility on society. To be deceived in good
company is excusable."</p>

<p>"You judge such matters from a worldly stand-point,
Aunt Caroline."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I am a woman of the world, my dear,"
said Mrs. Sheldon, shrugging her shoulders. "Well,
that completes our list, and we can prepare the cards
at our leisure."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>The same evening, about eight o'clock, the servant
entered Miss Dearborn's presence, and said:</p>

<p>"There is a young man at the door who wishes to
see you."</p>

<p>"Who is it? Did he give you his card?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe he has any, Miss Grace," said the
girl, laughing. "It's a boy about sixteen, and a little
girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's my train boy!" exclaimed Grace, with
animation.</p>

<p>Soon Paul and his little sister entered the room.</p>

<p>Our hero's manner was modest, but self-possessed,
while Grace clung to him bashfully.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you, Paul," said the young lady,
with a bright smile.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Dearborn."</p>

<p>"So this is your little sister, and my little namesake.
How do you do, my dear child?"</p>

<p>Grace answered, bashfully, that she was very well.</p>

<p>"You see, Miss Dearborn, Grace is wearing the
cloak you were kind enough to give her."</p>

<p>"And very well it becomes her, too. Is your mother
well, Paul?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Dearborn, thank you."</p>

<p>"I suppose she keeps house with Grace while you
are away during the day?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>"Yes; but she also sews when she has an opportunity."</p>

<p>"I suppose she is not very well paid sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Very poorly at the best; but in some cases those
who employ her are very mean. Now, there was Miss
Framley&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Framley!" repeated Grace, with interest.
"Tell me the story."</p>

<p>Paul did tell the story already familiar to us.</p>

<p>"And this person is to be present at my party!"
thought Grace, with an uncontrollable feeling of disgust.
"I shall find it hard to be ordinarily polite to
her."</p>

<p>"You must not think all ladies are as inconsiderate,
Paul," she said. "Has your mother leisure to do
some sewing for me?"</p>

<p>"She will be glad to do so, Miss Dearborn."</p>

<p>"Then, if you can call here to-morrow evening, I
will have a bundle ready. I shall pay her double the
price she charged Miss Framley."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Miss Dearborn, and my mother
will be overjoyed. I do not wish her to sew at all,
but she is unwilling to give it up."</p>

<p>Paul and his sister remained an hour, Grace exerting
herself far more to entertain them than she
would have done had they been fashionable callers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>"How did you like her, Gracie?" asked Paul, as
they were walking homeward.</p>

<p>"She's awful nice, Paul," said the little girl.</p>

<p>"So I think," said Paul.</p>

<small>THE ARTIST'S SECRET.</small></h2></div>


<p>Frederic Vernon sat in his studio, toying with his
brush. The canvas was before him, but he seemed to
be in a brown study.</p>

<p>"What has got into me?" he asked himself, impatiently.
"I cannot fix my mind upon my work. I am
no longer on the verge of destitution, or compelled to
labor for a mere pittance; yet my mind is less at ease
than when I hardly knew where the next day's food
was to come from."</p>

<p>Vernon's circumstances had improved. He had
taken a lighter and more cheerful studio, and moved
with his mother into better rooms. He was no longer
forced to court the penurious patronage of young ladies
like Miss Framley, and, thanks to the influence of
Miss Dearborn, he was never without some work in
hand. Yet, though he ought to have been cheerful,
he found himself restless, and his work often had to
wait upon his moods.</p>

<p>"Frederic, what is the matter with you?" asked his
mother, earnestly, one day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>"Why do you ask, mother? I am well," he answered,
evasively.</p>

<p>"You have lost your appetite, and your mind seems
preoccupied. Is anything troubling you?"</p>

<p>"Anything troubling me?" he asked, with a forced
smile. "What a strange idea!"</p>

<p>"Nay, my son; you cannot conceal it from your
mother's eyes that something is amiss with you. What
is it?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I cannot tell, mother."</p>

<p>"Is not your work proceeding well, Frederic?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I had another order to-day."</p>

<p>"You should look happy, then, my son. Compare
your position to-day with what it was three months
since. Then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was almost a beggar, mother."</p>

<p>"True."</p>

<p>"Forced to paint portraits for mean, shoddy people
for a mere song."</p>

<p>"Yes. But things have changed with you now,
Frederic."</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks to Providence&mdash;and Grace Dearborn."</p>

<p>Unconsciously he pronounced this name with a tenderness
which revealed to his mother something that
he had not intended she should know. A look of intelligence
overspread her face.</p>

<p>"I begin to see how it is, my boy," she said, gently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>"How what is, mother?"</p>

<p>"I think I understand what is the matter with you."</p>

<p>"Have you turned seeress?" he asked, smiling
faintly.</p>

<p>"No; but I can minister to a mind diseased when
I know the nature of the disease."</p>

<p>"Well, what is my disease, mother mine?" he asked,
lightly.</p>

<p>"Frederic, you are in love!"</p>

<p>"In love!" he repeated, flushing. "Then perhaps
you can tell with whom I am in love?"</p>

<p>"I think I can."</p>

<p>"Say on, mother."</p>

<p>"You love Grace Dearborn."</p>

<p>He started, and his face flushed.</p>

<p>"What makes you think that, mother?" he asked,
slowly.</p>

<p>"Your face would tell me if I had no other evidence.
Is it not true?"</p>

<p>"Well, mother, you have my secret," he answered,
after a pause. "You know my disease. Now canst
thou minister to a mind diseased?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so."</p>

<p>"I know what you would say. You would tell me
to root out the foolish fancy from my heart, and devote
myself unflinchingly to my art. Well, mother, I have
tried it, and I have failed."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>"You mistake me, Frederic. If you feel that your
love for this young lady is deep and earnest, such a
love as comes but once in a life-time, let her know of
it, and give her a chance to accept or reject it."</p>

<p>"Mother, are you mad? Do you know that Grace
Dearborn is a wealthy heiress&mdash;that she moves in the
most exclusive society of Chicago&mdash;that she is admired
by many who are rated as eligible matches?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know all that&mdash;or I have guessed it from
what you have told me. And what then?"</p>

<p>"Do you think of the difference between us? What
am I?"</p>

<p>"You are an artist, a gentleman, and a man of
talent."</p>

<p>"Even were it so, I earn, for my entire income, less
in all probability than this young lady spends for her
wardrobe in a single year."</p>

<p>"That may be, Frederic."</p>

<p>"And yet you bid me hope?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I bid you hope. If Miss Dearborn is what
I think she is, she will not set an undue estimate upon
wealth. She will understand how many vulgar and
ill-bred men possess it, and will rate higher the talent,
the refinement, and the culture of a gentleman, and
the good heart that makes him ever a loyal and affectionate
son. Such a man cannot fail to make a desirable
husband."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>"Ah, mother," said Vernon, smiling, "you are a
mother, and, like all mothers, you overrate your son.
If Grace would but look upon me with your eyes,
perhaps I might hope. As it is, were I to open my
lips to her, I should only subject myself to the mortification
of having my suit contemptuously spurned."</p>

<p>"That would never be. Even if rejected, there
would be nothing to injure your pride or bring a
blush of mortification to your cheek."</p>

<p>"I think you are right there, mother. Grace is too
gentle, too much of a lady, to let me see how unjustifiable
were my hopes."</p>

<p>"Frederic, will you be guided by me in this matter?"</p>

<p>"Let me hear your advice first, mother. Then I
will decide."</p>

<p>"Try to make yourself more worthy of her. Make
the most of your talent. Become something more
than a portrait painter. Become a great artist; and
when all men acknowledge your talent, Miss Dearborn
will be proud to accept your devotion, and to
reward it. Is my advice good?"</p>

<p>"Mother, you put new life into me," said the young
man, his face glowing with new hope. "I have always
wished to become a true artist. I am a portrait painter
because poverty made it necessary."</p>

<p>"And you would become an artist if you could?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it is my strongest wish."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>"Then form the plan of some great picture, select
some worthy and inspiring subject, devote your leisure
to it, and think that you are working for her you
love."</p>

<p>"I will mother. You are not only my best friend,
but my wisest counselor. Henceforth I shall feel that
I have an object for which to labor."</p>

<p>Frederic Vernon returned to his studio with quickened
steps, and resumed work with an ardor he had
not felt since Grace Dearborn sat in his studio as the
subject of his brush. It was some time before a suitable
idea came to him, but at last it flashed upon him,
and he gave to his picture all the time he could save
from his sittings.</p>

<p>In the midst of his labors there appeared to him
one day the postman.</p>

<p>It was a dainty missive he held in his hand, addressed,
in delicate chirography, to Frederic Vernon,
Esq.</p>

<p>Vernon opened it, and read with a quickened movement
of the heart a card of invitation to a party given
by Mrs. Caroline Sheldon, to celebrate the birthday of
her niece, Miss Grace Dearborn.</p>

<p>Vernon's face lighted up with joy.</p>

<p>"She has not forgotten me, then," he said to
himself.</p>

<p>Then came the thought, "Shall I go?" Would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
he feel at home in the fashionable circle to which he
would be a stranger? He hesitated, but it was not
for long.</p>

<p>"Since Grace bids me, for I know it was at her suggestion
that I am invited, I will attend."</p>

<p>Just then his studio was invaded by a young lady,
upon whose portrait he was engaged. She did not
come alone. With her was Major Ashton, who has
already been named as the unsuccessful suitor of
Grace.</p>

<p>Vernon laid down the invitation hastily, but it was
still open, and Major Ashton, who was observant, saw
it, and a glance revealed to him its contents.</p>

<p>His face betrayed his surprise and annoyance.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that Miss Dearborn has invited this
portrait painter to her party?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>Then his eyes dwelt critically on the refined and
handsome face of the artist, and a vague feeling of
jealousy sprang up within him, for he was still firmly
resolved upon marrying Grace.</p>

<p>"But no," he thought, recovering himself; "Grace
would not stoop to a fellow like that. She only wishes
to patronize him."</p>

<small>A FELLOW-CONSPIRATOR.</small></h2></div>


<p>Stephen Palmer, since his discomfiture, had not visited
his step-mother or Grace. He felt that he hated
the whole family, but most of all Paul. A bully never
forgives the one, boy or man, who humiliates him;
and Stephen felt the more mortified and incensed
because our hero was so much younger than himself.
Paul was his equal in height, but Stephen was broader
and stronger, and but for his habits of intoxication,
which robbed him of his strength, would have given
his young brother a good deal of trouble.</p>

<p>When Luke Denton first unfolded to Stephen the
plan he had in view for getting Paul into trouble, the
young man was delighted.</p>

<p>"What a head you've got, Luke!" he said, admiringly.</p>

<p>"You like the plan, then?" said Luke, who did not
object to flattery, though he had a very poor opinion
of Stephen's understanding.</p>

<p>"It's capital! Couldn't be better!" exclaimed Stephen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>"I flatter myself it's rather a clever notion," said
Luke, complacently. "You don't mind your brother
being arrested for theft, then?"</p>

<p>"No, curse him! He sets up for a young saint,
lectures me, who am almost old enough to be his
father."</p>

<p>"Still, he is your brother," said Luke, dryly.</p>

<p>"A pretty sort of brother he is! Why, he wouldn't
give me a penny to save me from starvation. The
other day, when I was dead broke, and wanted to
borrow a trifle, he made such a row that I had to give
it up. There isn't any love lost between Paul and
me."</p>

<p>"What will become of your mother and sister if
Paul goes to prison?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, and I don't care," said Stephen,
spitting viciously. "They may starve, for all I care."</p>

<p>"Upon my word, you're a relation worth having,"
said Luke, lazily puffing at a meerschaum pipe, for he
was somewhat fastidious in his tastes, and disdained
the common clay pipe which Stephen was not above
using.</p>

<p>In truth, he despised the man with whom he nevertheless
spent a considerable part of his time. There
was a community of vice between them, but Luke was
by nature refined and Stephen coarse.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't expect me to take the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
puppy's place and work for them, would you?" demanded
Stephen.</p>

<p>"If I had a mother and sister, I would do just
that," said Denton; and he spoke with sincerity, for,
with all his want of principle, he was not without
domestic affection.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't if you had folks like mine," said
Stephen. "They don't care a pinch of snuff for me."</p>

<p>"Strange, when you are so attractive&mdash;have such
taking ways," said Luke, ironically.</p>

<p>"Don't talk that way, Luke Denton, for I don't
like it," returned Stephen, sullenly.</p>

<p>"You must let me have my little joke, Stephen.
What would the world be without innocent mirth and
friendly banter? So you like my plan?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but can you do it? Can you play the
Quaker?"</p>

<p>"Dost thee doubt it?"</p>

<p>Stephen went off into a fit of laughter, though
there didn't seem much to laugh at.</p>

<p>"Don't be frivolous. Restrain thy mirth, and fix
thy mind on serious things," continued Luke, in a
tone which he thought befitting the words.</p>

<p>Again Stephen betrayed symptoms of suffocation.</p>

<p>He went out with Denton, and assisted in dressing
him in the costume which he hired for the successful
personation of a quiet Friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>"You'll do," he said, in high satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Dost thee feel sure, friend Stephen?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're too funny for anything! Shall I go
with you to the depot?"</p>

<p>"Not for a hundred dollars! It would destroy my
reputation as a grave and upright Quaker to be seen
in such disreputable company. I will go my ways
alone, friend Stephen, but anon I will return and favor
thee with a report of my success. If I don't fail, that
young brother of yours will spend the night at the
station-house."</p>

<p>"When he is tried I'll go and see it. It'll be nuts
to me to see the young sneak tried for theft."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best to carry out your kind wishes for
his welfare."</p>

<p>So Luke Denton set out on his errand, and we
already know how he fared&mdash;how into the pit which
he dug for another he fell himself. It was he and not
Paul that spent the night in confinement.</p>

<p>Stephen waited impatiently for his return. He was
eager to hear the details of the scheme, which he did
not doubt would turn out as he wished. He wanted
to hear how Paul acted when confronted with the
charge of theft, and was impatient to have the afternoon
pass away and Denton return.</p>

<p>But he waited in vain an hour or more after the
train should be in, and still his friend did not appear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Still, he did not dream that Denton himself had got
into trouble, and was hindered by circumstances
which he could not control from coming round to
see him.</p>

<p>As time passed he became more restless and anxious.</p>

<p>"Denton might have come round to tell me," he
muttered, peevishly. "He might have known that I
would want to hear."</p>

<p>After awhile he concluded to go round to Denton's
lodgings and see if he were in. He might be tired,
and lying down.</p>

<p>It was not far he had to go. Luke Denton lived in
more style than himself. When he was able he paid
his rent, and when his purse was low he did not pay.
If, after a time, his landlady became importunate, he
removed to some other place. Probably he did not
pay more rent&mdash;perhaps not as much&mdash;in the course
of a year as Stephen, for he had a more persuasive and
plausible manner, and could obtain credit on the score
of his appearance, while Stephen's only went against
him.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Denton in?" asked Stephen, of the servant
who answered his summons.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"I suppose he has been in this evening?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>"No; he went away early in the day, and has not
been home since."</p>

<p>"Can anything have happened to him?" thought
Stephen. "No, he could take care of himself. But
what a fool I am!" he exclaimed, with a sudden
thought. "Of course he wouldn't come home in
those Quaker clothes. Very likely he's carried 'em
back to the place where he borrowed 'em."</p>

<p>So Stephen went round there, but found the place
closed. There seemed no way of finding out what he
wanted to know that night. Yes, there was. He
would go round to the lodgings of Mrs. Palmer, and
find out whether Paul had returned. If not, he would
be safe in frightening them and demanding a loan, for,
as usual, he was short of money.</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," he said to himself. "If Paul
isn't at home, and has not been home, I'll know it's
all right, and Luke will be round in good time to tell
me how it all came out. Yes, that's the best thing I
can do."</p>

<p>So Stephen bent his steps in the direction of his
step-mother's humble home.</p>

<p>When his knock was heard, Paul said:</p>

<p>"Mother, that's Stephen's knock. Don't let him
know where I am. I'll hide in the next room, and
hear what he has to say. I suspect he had something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
to do with the attempt that was made to get me into
trouble to-day. Perhaps I can find out."</p>

<p>"If he asks me if you are here, what am I to say?
I must tell the truth."</p>

<p>Paul whispered a few words in his mother's ear, and
then hastily retreated into the inner room, while Mrs.
Palmer went forward and opened the door to her step-son.</p>

<small>AN UNWELCOME APPEARANCE.</small></h2></div>


<p>"Good-evening, mamma!" said Stephen, airily, as
he stepped over the threshold, and entered the room.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Stephen," said Mrs. Palmer, soberly.</p>

<p>Stephen glanced hastily in all directions in search of
Paul, and was glad to find no trace of him.</p>

<p>"Where's sister Grace?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"She has gone to bed, Stephen. She always goes
to bed at eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"Has she spent that gold piece yet, that she was
too selfish to lend to her poor brother?"</p>

<p>"That is a matter you can have no interest in,
Stephen."</p>

<p>"None of my business, eh?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say that."</p>

<p>"You meant it, all the same. Where's Paul?"</p>

<p>"Do you know where he is? Have you come to
tell me, Stephen?"</p>

<p>This question was asked with some appearance of
anxiety, and Stephen at once jumped to the conclusion
that all things had gone as he desired, and Paul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
had fallen into the trap which had been prepared for
him.</p>

<p>"Why, you don't mean to say the kid isn't at
home?" said Stephen, an irrepressible smile lighting
up his face. "Well, that's a good one. Most likely
he's in the station-house. Ho, ho!"</p>

<p>"And you laugh at the thought!" said Mrs. Palmer,
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, he ain't any better than other boys. You
think he can't do anything wrong, but I'll bet you
half a dollar he's been caught stealing or something."</p>

<p>"Wherever Paul is, I am sure he is not in the
station-house," said Mrs. Palmer, positively.</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that," chuckled Stephen.
"He's a sly one, Paul is. You wouldn't think
butter'd melt in his mouth, but I know him better'n
you do."</p>

<p>"Paul is a good son and brother, and always has
been."</p>

<p>"And I suppose I am not," sneered Stephen.</p>

<p>"You must question your own conscience on that
subject," said Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p>"You are only my step-mother. You don't expect
me to support you and the kids, do you?" asked
Stephen, coarsely.</p>

<p>"No; I only desire that you will let us alone. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
can get on without your help," returned the widow,
with dignity.</p>

<p>"That is, if Paul remains all right; but you can't
be sure of that. He may slip up any time, and become
a boarder at the expense of the State."</p>

<p>"If you have come here to slander Paul, you can
hardly expect that you will be welcome."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I know that Paul is your idol. He can't
do anything wrong. I shouldn't wonder if he was in
a scrape now."</p>

<p>"What kind of a scrape? Don't leave me in suspense,
Stephen."</p>

<p>Stephen Palmer was not over supplied with brains,
and he was foolish enough to fall into the trap, and
speak of what he could not be supposed to know.</p>

<p>"I heard a report," he said, "that Paul had been
arrested for stealing in the Milwaukee train to-day."</p>

<p>"Where did you get your information?" asked Mrs.
Palmer.</p>

<p>"She doesn't believe it," said Stephen to himself.
"Never mind; she may have to before long."</p>

<p>"I don't care to mention where I heard it," he answered.</p>

<p>"It is not true."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it isn't; but if that's the case, why doesn't
he come home?"</p>

<p>"He may have been detained by business."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>"Oh, yes; very important business!" chuckled
Stephen. "I guess he'll find it very important and
pressing."</p>

<p>"Is that what you have come to tell me, Stephen
Palmer?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly. The fact is, Mrs. Palmer, I am
hard up."</p>

<p>"I believe you always are."</p>

<p>"Right you are. The fact is, I am very unlucky.
Nothing seems to go right with me. I have a hard
struggle to get along."</p>

<p>"There's one remedy you might find, Stephen,"
said the widow, sternly.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Work."</p>

<p>"Work!" repeated Stephen, angrily. "And where
am I to find work? Haven't I tried to get something
to do everywhere?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but from what I know of you, I
presume not. A man who really wants to work won't
go so long without it as you have."</p>

<p>"Much you know about it. I tell you everything
is crowded. How much money do you think I have
got left?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?"</p>

<p>"That's all," said Stephen, drawing a quarter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
his vest-pocket and flipping it up in the air. "Mrs.
Palmer, you must help me."</p>

<p>"If you are hungry Stephen, though it is a late
hour, I will give you something to eat."</p>

<p>"Thank you! I don't want any of your cold victuals,"
sneered the vagabond.</p>

<p>"Then I can do nothing for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can. Give me the little girl's gold piece.
You needn't pretend that she has spent it, for I know
better."</p>

<p>"Whether that is the case or not, I decline to let
you have it."</p>

<p>"Look here, widow," said Stephen, his brow darkening,
"I ain't going to be trifled with or bluffed off;
not this time. When down here before I wasn't quite
myself, and that young puppy, Paul, thought it safe
to bully me. Things are different now. I am perfectly
sober, and I know what I'm about. So I tell
you once more I want that money, and I advise you
to get it for me, or else give me as much out of your
own pocket."</p>

<p>"Surely you are not in earnest, Stephen Palmer.
You won't persist in this unmanly demand?"</p>

<p>"Then you don't know me. Paul is not here to
defend you now, and I advise you not to make me
angry."</p>

<p>Stephen rose from his seat, and advanced toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
his step-mother with an ugly look on his mean, evil-looking
face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer started back, and uttered just one word:
"Paul!"</p>

<p>At the call, Paul, who had found it difficult to restrain
himself from rushing into the room sooner,
sprang through the door, and, his young face flaming
with just indignation, confronted his step-brother.</p>

<small>PAUL DEFENDS HIS MOTHER.</small></h2></div>


<p>To say that Stephen was astonished hardly expresses
the truth.</p>

<p>He stood with open mouth, staring at our hero, as
if panic-stricken by his sudden appearance.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?" he asked, amazement
prevailing over every other sensation.</p>

<p>"From the next room, where I heard your contemptible
attempt to extort money from my mother."</p>

<p>At another time Stephen would have resented this
speech, but now he was anxious to find out what had
happened to his friend, and how Paul had managed
to escape the snare that had been so carefully laid for
him.</p>

<p>"How long have you been at home?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I got home at the usual time. What makes you
ask?"</p>

<p>"Did anything happen to-day?" asked Stephen.</p>

<p>Foolishly he was betraying himself, and Paul saw
clearly that he knew of the plot, even if he were not
concerned in it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>He resolved that Stephen should betray himself yet
further.</p>

<p>"What should happen?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I heard you were arrested for theft," said Stephen.</p>

<p>"What kind of theft?"</p>

<p>"Stealing a wallet."</p>

<p>"Where did you hear it?"</p>

<p>"Never mind!" answered Stephen, sullenly. "I
heard it, and that's enough."</p>

<p>"It seems then you were misinformed."</p>

<p>"Didn't you have any trouble at all?" asked Stephen,
perplexed.</p>

<p>"Yes, something happened. A man pretended
that I had stolen his wallet."</p>

<p>"Didn't I say so!" Stephen exclaimed, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"This Dutchman&mdash;&mdash;" proceeded the train boy.</p>

<p>"Dutchman!" said Stephen, hastily. "I thought
it was a Quaker."</p>

<p>"Now I think of it, it was a Quaker," said Paul,
quietly.</p>

<p>"What made you say Dutchman?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to find out how much you knew about
it. Did you know this Quaker?"</p>

<p>"Did I know the Quaker? I don't know any
Quakers."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>"I thought you might. In that case, you won't
feel any interest in knowing what became of him."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;did anything happen to him?" asked Stephen,
in alarm.</p>

<p>"You seem anxious," said Paul, keenly.</p>

<p>"Don't trifle with me, boy. Tell me what happened
to him. As you've told part of the story you
may as well tell the rest."</p>

<p>"He proved to be no Quaker at all," said Paul.
"If he was a friend of yours, as I conclude, I think
you will have a chance to see him in court to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Arrested!" gasped Stephen, in dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes, his plan didn't succeed. It is probably a
disappointment to him and to you, but it serves you
both right for conspiring against a boy."</p>

<p>"Who said I had anything to do with it?" asked
Stephen.</p>

<p>"You have let it out yourself. I don't want any
further proof."</p>

<p>"After this base conspiracy against your step-brother,
Stephen Palmer," said the widow, with dignity,
"I hope you will have the decency to stay
away. Had you behaved with any decent regard to
the tie that exists between us, I would not say
this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll repent this, Mrs. Palmer!" said Stephen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
his face showing the malice he felt. "You treat me
like a dog, you and your son there. I'll be even with
you yet."</p>

<p>He left the room and the house, slamming the
door behind him, but he did not renew his demand
for money.</p>

<small>GRACE DEARBORN'S PARTY.</small></h2></div>


<p>The evening of Grace's birthday party arrived. A
large number of invitations had been sent out, for
Mrs. Sheldon had a large circle of acquaintances and
friends The daily papers had already mentioned the
forthcoming party as likely to be one of the most
memorable of the season.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheldon determined to spare no expense to
make it so. She was not vulgarly lavish, but there are
occasions when she thought money should be spent
freely. Moreover, she was determined to do what she
could to secure a brilliant matrimonial alliance for her
niece, of whose beauty she was justifiably proud. Indeed
she was a natural match-maker, though she was
compelled not to allow Grace to see her maneuvers
too plainly, as nothing would have been more repugnant
to the niece than to think she was set up as
a prize in a matrimonial lottery.</p>

<p>A professional confectioner was given <i>carte blanche</i>
for the supper, which was to be <i>recherche</i>, and the decorations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
were put into the hands of a man whose
taste was unimpeachable.</p>

<p>"Aunt Caroline," said Grace, "I am afraid you are
going to large expense on my party."</p>

<p>"Why should I not, my dear?"</p>

<p>"It seems wasteful. How many poor families could
be relieved by the money it will cost!"</p>

<p>"What a quixotic idea, Grace! In my opinion the
poor have quite enough done for them. Would you
have us give up all amusements for their sake?"</p>

<p>"No, I won't go so far as that. Still it ought to
check undue extravagance to reflect that we have
so many that are destitute among us."</p>

<p>"They shall have their turn, Grace. I am sure you
spend a great deal of money on the poor."</p>

<p>"Not half enough, aunt."</p>

<p>"Then spend more, but in this matter don't object
to my spending what I like."</p>

<p>"I know, my dear aunt, it is all done for my sake."</p>

<p>"And very properly, my dear. I have no daughter,
and all my interest centers in you. By the way, I met
Major Ashton in the street yesterday."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Grace, indifferently.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow, he looks downcast. Your repulse
has wounded him sorely. He loved you deeply."</p>

<p>A silvery laugh from Grace greeted this announcement,
made with due solemnity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>"Really, my dear aunt," she said, "I can't conceive
of Major Ashton loving anybody as well as
himself."</p>

<p>"You do him wrong, Grace."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, but I do not believe it."</p>

<p>"He is coming to the party."</p>

<p>"I supposed he would," said Grace, shrugging her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"And I do hope, Grace, you will treat him kindly."</p>

<p>"I shall treat him politely, Aunt Caroline, if that is
what you mean. That is my duty, since he is to be
our guest."</p>

<p>"Major Ashton could marry brilliantly."</p>

<p>"Let him, then."</p>

<p>"Everybody considers him an eligible <i>parti</i>."</p>

<p>"Then there is little cause for me to pity him.
There are plenty who will have compassion on him,
and console him for my coldness."</p>

<p>"You must admit that he is a thorough gentleman,
Grace."</p>

<p>"My dear aunt, I am rather tired of Major Ashton
as a topic of conversation. Suppose we drop him. I
am ready to admit everything you desire&mdash;he is elegant,
a good match, fascinating, if you will, but he
will need to carry his fascinations to another market."</p>

<p>"She seems resolute," thought Mrs. Sheldon, "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
she may change her mind after all. Who was it said it
is always best to begin with a little aversion?"</p>

<p>In fact, Mrs. Sheldon had gone so far as to encourage
Major Ashton, and led him to think that there
was hope for him after all. He was very ready to
accept this assurance, because he desired to do so.
There was no danger, however, of the major breaking
his heart, for it was Grace's fortune he was in love
with, not herself. In fact, he was so far from romantic
that the idea crossed his mind that if the niece
refused to have anything to do with him, he might
perhaps take up with the aunt.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sheldon is a well-preserved woman," he
reflected, "fifteen years older than myself, perhaps,
but her fortune is even greater than Miss Dearborn's,
and would set my affairs right at once, besides insuring
my comfort for the balance of my life. She must
be worth at least a quarter of a million."</p>

<p>Thinking, then, of the widow as a <i>dernier resort</i>, he
treated her with a flattering deference and courtly politeness
that prepossessed her still more in his favor,
though she had not the faintest idea of the direction
of his thoughts with regard to herself.</p>

<p>At last the evening came. The house was a blaze
of light and splendor. Carriage after carriage rolled
up the street and deposited its load at Mrs. Sheldon's
door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>Presently the rooms were well filled with elegantly
dressed ladies and irreproachably attired young men,
who, in turn, paid their respects to the givers of the
party.</p>

<p>Grace was tastefully and even richly dressed, but
suffered herself, in the matter of attire, to be eclipsed
by more than one of her guests. Her aunt insisted on
her wearing a superb diamond necklace belonging to
herself, but she declined.</p>

<p>"No, aunt; I don't want to array myself in borrowed
plumes," she said. "The necklace is yours;
wear it yourself."</p>

<p>Which Mrs. Sheldon did at last. She was ready to
lend it to her niece, but was not insensible to the
glances of admiration which it attracted when displayed
on her own neck.</p>

<p>"It must be worth twenty thousand dollars!"
thought Major Ashton. "Really, the old girl is
radiant. If she ever becomes Mrs. Major Ashton,
in place of her niece resigned, I shall slyly substitute
a necklace of paste and convert the jewels to my own
use. It is sinful that so much good money should be
locked up."</p>

<p>It was well for the major's popularity with Mrs.
Sheldon that she could not read his thoughts. Her
necklace was her most valued possession, and nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
except actual need would have induced her to part
with it.</p>

<p>Grace looked about from time to time for the
young artist.</p>

<p>Finally she saw him approaching to salute her.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you here, Mr. Vernon," she said,
with a smile of welcome. "You are late."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Dearborn. I hope you will excuse it.
As you are aware, I have few acquaintances here&mdash;indeed
I do not often stray into such fashionable surroundings&mdash;and
only came for a brief space, to show
my appreciation of your kind courtesy in inviting me
here, and to offer my congratulations on your birthday."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Vernon, they are welcome. I
hope your mother is well."</p>

<p>"Very well, thank you, and I am sure she will feel
proud of your inquiry."</p>

<p>"I believe most of my guests have arrived, and I
may venture to leave my duties as assistant hostess.
If you will favor me with your arm, I will walk about
a little."</p>

<p>With a flush of gratification the artist tendered his
arm, and the two promenaded through the elegant
parlors, attracting general attention.</p>

<p>"Why, I declare!" said Miss Framley to her escort;
"do you see that?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>"See what?"</p>

<p>"Miss Dearborn, promenading with that young
man?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't she? He is quite distinguished in
his appearance."</p>

<p>"Distinguished?" repeated Miss Framley, with a
sneer. "I guess you don't know him."</p>

<p>"He isn't a cook, is he&mdash;or a waiter?"</p>

<p>"No; but he is a poor portrait painter. Why, he
painted my picture for twenty dollars, and he was glad
of the job," said Miss Framley, who was innately
vulgar.</p>

<p>"Poor devil! Then he must have been hard up,"
said the gentleman, to whom it occurred that this was
an illustration of Miss Framley's meanness.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he was poor enough; but I believe he is
doing a little better now. Still, it is singular that Miss
Dearborn should single him out as her escort from so
many. I wouldn't promenade with him!" continued
the young lady, tossing her head.</p>

<p>"I ought to feel flattered that you prefer me, Miss
Framley."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are quite a different kind of person,"
said the young lady, with a coquettish smile.</p>

<p>There was another who saw the two pass him with
equal disgust, and more dissatisfaction. This was
Major Ashton.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>"Upon my soul!" he said to himself. "What can
Grace Dearborn see in that beggar? I'll soon separate
them!"</p>

<p>He stepped up with his usual assurance, and, bowing,
said:</p>

<p>"May I venture to relieve this gentleman of his
pleasant duty, and substitute myself in his place?"</p>

<p>"Not at present, Major Ashton," said Grace, coldly;
"unless Mr. Vernon is weary of his charge."</p>

<p>"Far from it," said the young artist.</p>

<p>"Presuming puppy!" muttered Major Ashton, as
the two passed on.</p>

<small>THE ARTIST'S RECREATION.</small></h2></div>


<p>Whether Frederic Vernon read in Major Ashton's
face the disgust he felt at the compliment Grace bestowed
upon him in singling him out as her companion,
I am not sure. It is clear, however, that the
young artist cared little for it. He was enjoying the
companionship of the only young lady who had ever
had power to stir his heart, and for the moment did
not allow himself to think of the distance between
them.</p>

<p>Grace, on her part, was not insensible to the fact
that Vernon, though poor, was as noble in appearance
as any of her guests. The young artist had been remarkably
extravagant in providing himself with a dress-suit
of fine quality, and no one would argue his poverty
from his appearance.</p>

<p>"I hope, Mr. Vernon," said the heiress, "that you
have plenty of orders."</p>

<p>"Enough, at all events, to fill up my time," answered
Vernon, "thanks, I am very sure, to your
friendly recommendation."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>"I feel entirely justified in recommending you,"
said Grace.</p>

<p>"It is friendly, nevertheless."</p>

<p>"I shall not dispute that, for I wish to be friendly."</p>

<p>"I am sincerely grateful for all your kindness, Miss
Dearborn," said the artist, earnestly. "It has done
me more good than perhaps you dream of."</p>

<p>"I am sincerely glad to hear it, Mr. Vernon."</p>

<p>"Before painting your portrait I will confess that I
was tempted at times to despair. I had been for a
long time struggling hard, and apparently with little
hopes of success. My sitters were unwilling to pay
me even the paltry price I asked."</p>

<p>"I believe the young lady we have just passed was
one of your sitters?" said Grace, referring to Miss
Framley, who had bestowed her attentions upon a
callow youth of eighteen, failing to secure a more
eligible partner.</p>

<p>"Miss Framley? Yes; but I have small cause to
desire such a patronage. She stared at me as I entered,
as if surprised to meet me here."</p>

<p>"I trust it did not pain you much," said Grace,
archly.</p>

<p>Vernon laughed.</p>

<p>"I hope I shall have no worse troubles," he said.
"To that I am resigned."</p>

<p>"Then I shall be quite at ease about you on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
score. And now, Mr. Vernon, I fear I must ask you
to hand me to a seat, as my other guests will be
claiming my attention."</p>

<p>"Thank you for favoring me so far, Miss Dearborn,"
said Vernon, as he complied with the young
lady's request.</p>

<p>The young artist caught sight of one of his late
sitters, and presenting himself, was graciously received,
so that he was not compelled to be a wall-flower.</p>

<p>"It would be like his impudence," thought Miss
Framley, "for the penniless artist to make up to me.
If he does, I will soon send him about his business."</p>

<p>Miss Framley did not have the opportunity, however,
to give Vernon the rebuff she had in view, as he
took no notice of her save by a slight bow. This annoyed
her, and she straightway charged him mentally
with ingratitude in slighting one of his patrons. Consistency
was not one of Miss Framley's strong points.
Had she seen him leaning against the wall unnoticed,
she would have been pleased; but Vernon, who was
gifted with unusual external attractions, seemed to
have no difficulty in making his way, and was kindly
received by young ladies whom Miss Framley was
compelled to acknowledge as her social superiors. She
looked on discontentedly from a corner where she was
temporarily pining from neglect, when Major Ashton
approached. He was far from admiring Miss Framley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
but he knew that her father was reputed rich, and he
thought it best to keep in with her as a possible resort
in the event of his other plans failing.</p>

<p>"Are you in a reverie, Miss Framley?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not precisely, Major Ashton," responded the young
lady, smiling with pleasure at being noticed by so
desirable an acquaintance; "I was resting for a moment.
Really fashionable life is so exhausting&mdash;parties
and engagements nearly every night in the week.
However, you know all about that."</p>

<p>"I am not so easily fatigued, perhaps, as if I belonged
to the fairer sex. Will you accept my arm for
a promenade, or are you too much fatigued?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am quite rested, I assure you," said the
young lady, joyfully.</p>

<p>"I see the portrait painter is here," remarked Major
Ashton, with a carelessness he did not feel.</p>

<p>"Yes; isn't it strange Miss Dearborn should invite
him?" returned Miss Framley, eagerly. "Really almost
a beggar, as you may say."</p>

<p>"Is he poor, then?" asked the major.</p>

<p>"He was miserably poor, but I believe he is doing
better now. Why, he used to paint portraits for twenty
dollars!"</p>

<p>"Hardly enough to pay for the materials," said Ashton,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, he was glad enough to get orders at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
price. I took pity on him myself, and gave him an
order."</p>

<p>"Very considerate of you, upon my word!" said
Major Ashton.</p>

<p>If there was sarcasm in his words, Miss Framley,
who was not over sharp, except in money matters, did
not perceive it.</p>

<p>"I always try to be considerate," she responded,
complacently. "But, as you were saying, it is very
singular Miss Dearborn should pay so much attention
to a man in his sphere of life."</p>

<p>"I think it was you who said it, Miss Framley;
however, I am disposed to agree with you."</p>

<p>"And then she selects him as her first escort, and
lowers herself, as one may say, to his level."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she feels a special interest in him," suggested
Major Ashton.</p>

<p>There was a suspicion of jealousy in his tone as he
said this.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no! That would be too ridiculous.
She may feel a patronizing interest in him, and think
it will do him good in the way of business to pay him
attention. Grace is so quixotic, you know, Major
Ashton."</p>

<p>Grace would have been amazed had she heard herself
spoken of so familiarly by a young lady to whom
she had hardly spoken a dozen words in her life.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>"I suppose you are quite intimate with her?" said
Miss Framley's escort, pointedly.</p>

<p>"Why, no; I can't say we are intimate," said Miss
Framley, slowly; "although, of course, I know her
very well."</p>

<p>"I infer from what you say that I shall not be
likely to meet the portrait painter at your house, Miss
Framley."</p>

<p>"Decidedly not!" said the young lady, tossing her
head. "I hope I choose my company better. I am
sure I don't know what ma would say if I should introduce
such a person into the house&mdash;ma is <i>very</i>
particular."</p>

<p>"And very properly, I am sure."</p>

<p>Major Ashton politely refrained from laughing,
though he happened to know that Mrs. Framley, who
was now so very particular, had been a very respectable
saleswoman in a small dry-goods store up to the
time of her marriage with Jeremiah Framley, who was
at that time a drummer in the employ of a second-class
house in the city.</p>

<p>"Miss Framley is very amusing," thought the major,
"though I fancy she would be a great bore to a matrimonial
partner. I hope it may never be my sad destiny
to marry her; though, as her father is rich, I may
some day sacrifice myself to her."</p>

<p>How we deceive ourselves! Miss Framley was under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the impression that the stylish major, of whose
attentions she was proud, was struck with her, and she
was already speculating as to the prominent place she
might take in society as Mrs. Major Ashton, when a
waltz struck up.</p>

<p>"Shall we dance, or are you too fatigued?" asked
the major.</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all! It has quite passed off, I assure
you," said the delighted young lady, and they moved
off to the inspiring strains of one of Strauss' waltzes.</p>

<p>Miss Framley didn't appear to advantage as a dancer.
Her figure was dumpy, and she had no ear for music,
so that her pace was somewhat heavy and elephantine.
The major was a graceful dancer, but it was all he
could do to make up for his partner's deficiencies.
He soon tired of the attempt, and handed his unwilling
partner to a seat.</p>

<p>"I was not at all tired, major," she said, insinuatingly.</p>

<p>"But I was," he answered, rather abruptly.</p>

<p>He took leave with a bow, and five minutes later
found the opportunity which he had been seeking all
the evening to speak to Miss Dearborn.</p>

<small>A PERSEVERING SUITOR.</small></h2></div>


<p>Grace saw the approach of Major Ashton, and surmised
his object in seeking an interview. She would
have avoided it, but she was at the moment unengaged,
and Major Ashton was one of her guests. She
owed him a measure of courtesy.</p>

<p>When he offered his arm she accepted it with a
bow, which she tried to accompany with a cordial
manner.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you on the success of your party,
Miss Dearborn," the major commenced.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Major Ashton. Then I may consider
it such?"</p>

<p>"Decidedly. I trust it may prove auspicious, since
it is given in honor of your birthday."</p>

<p>"Thank you again. You are very kind."</p>

<p>"Shall we go into the conservatory?" asked Major
Ashton, as they approached the door that led into it.</p>

<p>"As you please," said Grace, hesitating.</p>

<p>She was considering how soon she could politely
get rid of the major.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>They entered the conservatory, which at the time
was occupied by another couple.</p>

<p>Major Ashton glanced at them with a frown, for
they were in his way.</p>

<p>Presently they went back into the parlor, and his
opportunity was found.</p>

<p>"Miss Dearborn&mdash;Grace," he began, hurriedly, "I
have been waiting for this chance to speak to you. I
hope you have reconsidered your answer to my suit. I
hope you have reflected how much my happiness is involved
in your smiling upon my love."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you have renewed the subject, Major
Ashton," said Grace, her cheek flushing with the annoyance
she felt.</p>

<p>"I could not do otherwise. I am pleading for
life."</p>

<p>The words and tone were earnest enough, but failed
to convey to Grace the idea of sincerity.</p>

<p>She was persuaded that Major Ashton, less than any
of her acquaintances, was in danger of dying of a
broken heart, and she felt provoked that he should
try to impose upon her.</p>

<p>"Let me suggest, Major Ashton," she said, "that
you have ill chosen your opportunity. To-night, at
least, you might spare me."</p>

<p>"Spare you!" repeated Major Ashton, in evident
pique. "Is then what I say so disagreeable to you?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>"It is unwelcome tonight at least."</p>

<p>"Then will you grant me another interview?" he
asked, earnestly. "Doubtless you are right. I should
not take up your time to-night. I will leave you at
once if you will let me call to-morrow, or any other
day soon."</p>

<p>"You may call, if you desire it, but I must say,
plainly, that it will do no good. The answer I have
already given you is final."</p>

<p>"I am not accustomed to be treated with such disdain,"
said Ashton, biting his lip. "It may seem
conceited to say so, but there is more than one
young lady here to-night who would gladly accept
what I have offered you. Miss Framley for instance."</p>

<p>"Then let me suggest that you offer your heart
where it will be gladly accepted," returned Grace,
calmly.</p>

<p>If Major Ashton fancied he could excite Miss
Dearborn's jealousy, the fancy was a very ridiculous
one.</p>

<p>She was entirely willing he should bestow himself
wherever he chose&mdash;even upon Miss Framley.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't think I would throw myself
away upon a vulgar shoddyite like Miss Framley."</p>

<p>"Miss Framley is my guest, Major Ashton," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Grace, with quiet dignity. "It doesn't become me
to hear any words to her discredit."</p>

<p>"I think I can penetrate your secret, Miss Dearborn,"
said Major Ashton, with a sneer. "You look
with favor upon that poverty-stricken portrait painter
with whom you so ostentatiously paraded early in the
evening."</p>

<p>"You forget yourself, Major Ashton," said Grace,
with chilling hauteur.</p>

<p>She dropped his arm, and left the conservatory unattended,
her cheek flushed, and her heart stirred with
indignation.</p>

<p>She came nearer to hating Major Ashton at that
moment than ever before. He had insulted her, and
though she was not one to make a scene, she was not
likely soon to forgive or to forget it.</p>

<p>Yet there was something in his words which was
not altogether displeasing. They let in a sudden light,
by which she read her own heart, and, with a quicker
pulsation, she was compelled to confess that she did
feel an interest in the young artist.</p>

<p>Just then, too, lifting her eyes, she met the gaze of
Frederic Vernon fixed upon her with an intensity
which she could not fail to interpret.</p>

<p>"He loves me!" she thought, and the thought gave
her no displeasure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>She had no time to analyze her feelings, but of this
she felt certain.</p>

<p>Vernon, meeting her gaze, turned away in some
confusion, but Grace was mistress of herself. Approaching
him, she said, smiling:</p>

<p>"I hope you are enjoying yourself, Mr. Vernon."</p>

<p>"More so than I anticipated, Miss Dearborn," he
answered, recovering himself.</p>

<p>"Then you did not anticipate enjoyment?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Nay, do not misunderstand me. I am of late a
stranger to such gay scenes, and I did not expect to
meet many whom I knew, or with whom I could converse."</p>

<p>"There is Miss Framley," said Grace.</p>

<p>"Miss Framley does not feel inclined to notice me.
I think she considers me too humble for recognition."</p>

<p>"That is amusing, certainly," said Grace.</p>

<p>"It is quite true."</p>

<p>"I sympathize with you, Mr. Vernon. Do not let
Miss Framley's cruelty weigh upon you."</p>

<p>"I can bear it since I have your sympathy," answered
Vernon, smiling brightly.</p>

<p>"How handsome he is when he smiles," thought
Grace. "It is clear he is a gentleman, notwithstanding
the sneer of Major Ashton."</p>

<p>"Pardon me if I leave your parlor early, Miss Dearborn,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
said Vernon. "I may not readily gain opportunity
of seeing you to take leave, and do so now."</p>

<p>"But why do you leave us so early, Mr. Vernon?"</p>

<p>"My mother will sit up till I return, and for her
the hour is already late."</p>

<p>"Then I will make no protest. A mother should
always be considered."</p>

<p>"I was sure you would understand my reason. I
shall be able to tell her that I have enjoyed myself.
She wished me to come."</p>

<p>"You must introduce me to your mother some day,
Mr. Vernon. I want to know her."</p>

<p>"And she will be delighted to know you."</p>

<p>Of all the gay company Frederic Vernon was the
first to go.</p>

<p>"So the portrait painter is gone!" said Major Ashton
to Miss Framley, whom he ran across once more.</p>

<p>"Yes. Poor fellow, he was evidently out of his
element, and anxious to get away."</p>

<p>"Could not you detain him, Miss Framley, by your
powerful fascinations?"</p>

<p>"As if I would try!" returned Miss Framley, tossing
her head.</p>

<p>"You are too cruel!"</p>

<p>"He looked at me as if he would like to claim acquaintance,"
said Miss Framley, complacently, "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
I can tell you, Major Ashton, I am very careful about
my company."</p>

<p>"But he was an acquaintance of yours," said
Ashton.</p>

<p>"In the same way that ma knows the butcher and
baker. I don't choose to let him think we are social
equals. American society is too promiscuous, as ma
often says. Don't you think so yourself, Major Ashton?"</p>

<p>"No doubt your honored mother is right," answered
Ashton, with a mocking smile.</p>

<p>"How nice it must be to live in England, and meet
those dear, delightful earls, and dukes, and barons!"
exclaimed Miss Framley, rapturously. "Did you ever
know an earl or a duke, Major Ashton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I made the acquaintance of an earl once.
We were passengers on the same steamer."</p>

<p>"Dear me, what a privilege! And how did he
look?"</p>

<p>"To the best of my remembrance he had the same
number of eyes and ears as the rest of us."</p>

<p>"But didn't he look very <i>distangay</i>? Oh, how I
should have admired to know him!"</p>

<p>"He seemed very plain-looking, and he was perhaps
the worst dressed man among the passengers."</p>

<p>"That is so strange!"</p>

<p>Miss Framley's idea of an earl or a duke was a tall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
majestic person, attired in purple and fine linen, with
high-bred, aristocratic features, that might readily distinguish
him from inferior beings.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I envy you the privilege of knowing
him! Did you really become intimate?"</p>

<p>"Very!" answered Major Ashton, concealing under
a grave face the amusement he felt. "He told me
confidentially how disagreeable his mother-in-law, the
Countess of Somerset, was, and asked my advice as to
how to manage her."</p>

<p>"How interesting!" ejaculated Miss Framley, opening
wide her eyes, as she speedily swallowed the major's
words.</p>

<p>She felt that it was something to know the intimate
mind of an earl. She remained till the end of the
party, and went home fully persuaded that Major Ashton
admired her.</p>

<small>MISS FRAMLEY'S MORTIFICATION.</small></h2></div>


<p>"Paul," said Mrs. Palmer, "are you at leisure this
evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, if you have anything for me to do."</p>

<p>Paul had another plan for the evening, but he felt
that duty required him to defer that, and place himself
at the service of his mother. In this he showed a
good feeling and sense of duty which may well be
copied by such of my readers as are young and dependent
upon their parents for more than they fully
understand.</p>

<p>"I don't like to take up your time when you have
been all day at work for us."</p>

<p>"Never mind that, mother. Why, I enjoy my
work. I should feel lost without it."</p>

<p>"I have got Miss Dearborn's work done, Paul, and
if you can spare time, I should like to have you take
it to her."</p>

<p>"I am perfectly ready to do that, mother," said
Paul, promptly, "I shall be glad to see her on my
own account."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>"I don't know how much I ought to charge her for
the work," said Mrs. Palmer, reflecting.</p>

<p>"I don't believe she will object to your price,
mother, whatever it is. She is quite a different young
lady from Miss Framley."</p>

<p>"Then you may say two dollars, if she asks the
price," said his mother.</p>

<p>The work was neatly done up, and Paul took
charge of it.</p>

<p>At about eight o'clock he ascended the steps of
Mrs. Sheldon's handsome house, and rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Dearborn at home?" he asked of the
servant who answered his summons.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Grace, smiling, for she chanced to
hear the question as she passed through the hall.
"Good-evening, Paul. How is your little sister?"</p>

<p>"Very well, Miss Dearborn. If she had known I
was coming here, she would have wanted to come,
too."</p>

<p>"You must bring her soon."</p>

<p>"Won't she trouble you, Miss Dearborn?"</p>

<p>"Children never trouble me. I like them. Come
in and sit down," for Paul was still standing in the
vestibule. "I suppose you have brought my work."</p>

<p>"Yes; mother has finished it."</p>

<p>"Sarah, you may take the bundle."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>"Won't you look at it, Miss Dearborn? Perhaps it
may not suit you."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of that, Paul. Still I will examine
it."</p>

<p>The examination was followed by cordial praise,
which was deserved, for Mrs. Palmer was an admirable
needlewoman.</p>

<p>"Did your mother mention the price, Paul?" asked
the young lady.</p>

<p>"She named two dollars."</p>

<p>Grace drew out a pearl porte-monnaie, and drew
therefrom a bill, which she handed to Paul.</p>

<p>"Give your mother that, with my compliments on
her good work," she said.</p>

<p>Paul saw that it was a five-dollar bill.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I can't change this," he said.</p>

<p>"It is not necessary," returned Grace, with a smile.</p>

<p>"But it is a five. I said two dollars."</p>

<p>"Tell your mother that if she thinks this too
much, she may regard the balance as a gift."</p>

<p>"You are very generous, Miss Dearborn," said
Paul, his eyes brightening with the thought of his
mother's pleasure when she received such liberal payment.</p>

<p>"If I am, I can take small credit for it, since I am
blessed with a fortune."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>"I wish all rich people were like you," said Paul,
impulsively.</p>

<p>"Don't flatter me, Paul. I am probably vain
enough already."</p>

<p>"I may thank you at any rate, Miss Dearborn."</p>

<p>Paul rose to go, not wishing to intrude further upon
the young lady.</p>

<p>"If you are going home directly, will you object to
taking some more work to your mother?"</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to do it."</p>

<p>"Then wait here five minutes and I will send Sarah
to you with a bundle. Say to your mother that I shall
be able to give her almost constant employment, as I
am interested in a number of poor families for whom
I have garments made up as the most useful gifts I
can bestow upon them."</p>

<p>"This will be good news to mother."</p>

<p>"Then I shall be the better pleased if I can oblige
her while securing excellent work."</p>

<p>Paul went home directly, with the more alacrity
because he had such good news to communicate. His
mother, as he anticipated, was very much elated by her
good fortune.</p>

<p>"It is so different from Miss Framley's way of dealing,"
she said.</p>

<p>"There are not many young ladies like Miss Dearborn,"
said Paul.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>"You are right there, Paul. If there were more,
the world would be better off."</p>

<p>Just then the postman called with a postal for Mrs.
Palmer.</p>

<p>It ran thus:</p>


<p class="blockquot">"Miss Framley will be obliged if Mrs. Palmer will call
or send to her house to-morrow evening for some work. She
hopes that Mrs. Palmer will not be unreasonable in her
charges."</p>

<p>"That's cool!" ejaculated Paul.</p>

<p>"I thought Miss Framley did not intend to give
me any more work," said his mother.</p>

<p>"So she said, but it seems she has changed her
mind."</p>

<p>"I didn't think she would."</p>

<p>"Oh, she probably finds it difficult to get her work
done as well elsewhere, and finds it for her interest to
employ you again."</p>

<p>"She will think any fair price unreasonable."</p>

<p>"Of course she will. If you will be guided by my
advice, mother, you will decline to take her work
again."</p>

<p>"It is certainly unpleasant working for one who is
unwilling to pay fairly."</p>

<p>"Then don't do it. Miss Dearborn said she would
give you enough work to occupy your time, and you
know she will pay you handsomely."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>"Then if you think best, Paul," said Mrs. Palmer,
doubtfully, for it seemed a rash thing, in the light of
her former struggles, to decline work.</p>

<p>"I do think it best, mother, and I shall be glad to
call there myself and give her your answer."</p>

<p>The next evening, therefore, Paul repaired to the
Framley mansion, and found the young lady at home.
He was not invited in, but Miss Framley came to the
door to speak to him.</p>

<p>"You sent a postal to my mother, Miss Framley,"
he commenced.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are the Palmer boy," said Miss Framley,
condescendingly.</p>

<p>"My name is Paul Palmer."</p>

<p>"I have decided to let your mother have my work
again, though she charged an extortionate price for the
last."</p>

<p>The fact was, as Paul surmised, that Miss Framley
had found it impossible to find any other seamstress
whose work pleased her as much as his mother's,
but of course she did not choose to admit that. She
preferred to have it understood that she was conferring
a favor.</p>

<p>"My mother never charges extortionate prices,"
said Paul, gravely.</p>

<p>"As a boy, you are not a suitable judge," said the
young lady, sharply. "You may say to your mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
that there are plenty who would like to do my work,
but as she is a widow, and poor, I have taken pity on
her, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no occasion for that, Miss Framley," said
Paul. "My mother can get along very well without
your work."</p>

<p>"It seems to me you are taking a great deal on
yourself, young man," said Miss Framley, sharply.
"I have a great mind to give out my work elsewhere."</p>

<p>"You will have to do that, Miss Framley," said
Paul, with evident satisfaction, "for my mother requests
me to say that she cannot do any more work
for you."</p>

<p>"Did she tell you to say this?" demanded Miss
Framley, astonished.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I never heard of such a thing!" ejaculated the
mortified young lady. "Are you sure this is not
a message of your own?"</p>

<p>"Quite so. Miss Dearborn has promised her as
much work as she can do, at about three times the
rate you are willing to pay. Good-evening!"</p>

<p>"I believe I hate Miss Dearborn?" inwardly commented
the vexed Miss Framley. "Somehow she
interferes with me in everything I undertake. If she
chooses to throw away her money, I sha'n't. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
now where am I to find another seamstress like Mrs.
Palmer? I wish I hadn't offended her."</p>

<p>But it was too late. Miss Framley must pay the
penalty of her meanness.</p>

<p>Paul walked home, feeling that the day had been an
unusually satisfactory one. Yet how little can we foresee
the future? Within the next twenty-four hours a
great danger menaced him.</p>

<small>AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE.</small></h2></div>


<p>Paul was on his way home, when, in turning a
corner, he came face to face with his step-brother,
Stephen. The latter was much better dressed than
when Paul last saw him. He had thrown aside the
shabby and soiled suit, which had seen service so long
that it looked entitled to be relieved upon a pension.
He wore now a new suit, which did not fit him particularly
well, having evidently been purchased at a
ready-made clothing store, but it was at least new, and
made Stephen look as respectable as the nature of the
case would admit.</p>

<p>"Hallo, young one!" said Stephen, with a grin;
"where are you bound?"</p>

<p>"I'm going home," answered Paul, surveying his
half-brother with a puzzled glance.</p>

<p>"How's the old lady?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean my mother?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. I don't mean Grace."</p>

<p>"She's well," answered Paul, briefly.</p>

<p>"She don't like me, and she don't treat me well,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
said Stephen; "but I don't bear no malice. The
world is big enough for both of us."</p>

<p>"I hope you are prospering," said Paul, again
regarding the new suit.</p>

<p>"Yes; I'm getting along better'n I was. How do
you like my clothes?"</p>

<p>"They are an improvement on your old ones."</p>

<p>"I should say so myself. Come, Paul, you're a
smart boy, if you are rather cranky sometimes. Being
as we are brothers, I'll stand treat. Come in and take
a drink."</p>

<p>He made a movement to enter a saloon close at
hand, but Paul held back.</p>

<p>"Thank you all the same, Stephen," he said, "but
I don't drink."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid. It'll do you good."</p>

<p>Paul shook his head. He knew it would do no
good to argue the point, so he simply declined once
more.</p>

<p>"Don't be offended, Stephen," he said. "I should
have no objection to drinking with you if I drank at
all, but I've signed the pledge."</p>

<p>"None but babies and simpletons sign the pledge,"
said Stephen, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"If that's the case, you will have to count me either
the one or the other."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>"Can you change me a ten?" asked Stephen, drawing
out a wallet, and producing a ten-dollar bill.</p>

<p>"I haven't so much money with me," answered
Paul, rather surprised at Stephen's wealth, for he saw
other bills besides in the pocket-book.</p>

<p>"If you had a five now, I'd exchange, and let you
give the balance to sister Grace as a present, so that
she needn't think brother Stephen quite so bad as she
thinks."</p>

<p>Paul did not have a five, having given the one he
received from Miss Dearborn to his mother. Even if he
had had it with him, he would have felt indisposed to
avail himself of his half-brother's surprising generosity,
having grievous doubts whether Stephen had come by
his present wealth honestly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Stephen," he said. "I haven't a five,
but I thank you all the same for your offer. You must
have found profitable employment."</p>

<p>This was said with a rising inflection calculated to
call for Stephen's confidence, but the latter evaded the
inquiry.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been lucky," he answered. "I've been
speculating."</p>

<p>Again Paul was puzzled. How could Stephen speculate
without capital, for it was quite certain that he
had none.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>"If I only had a five," Stephen said, meditatively,
"I'd hand you one for Grace."</p>

<p>"Some other time," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Well, good-night. Tell Grace I wanted to send
her something. Tell your mother, too, and she may
think better of me. If you won't drink with me, I
shall have to drink by myself."</p>

<p>With a hasty nod, Stephen opened the door of the
saloon and entered, while Paul resumed his journey
home.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it at all," he said to himself.
"I never saw Stephen in such a generous mood before.
How can he have got hold of all that money?
I hope it is honestly come by. I think I had better
not tell mother about his offer, or she might relent
and invite him to call. We shall do better without
him."</p>

<small>A CATASTROPHE.</small></h2></div>


<p>"All the latest magazines and papers! Harper's,
Frank Leslie's, the <i>New York Weekly</i>!"</p>

<p>Of course the speaker was Paul, and he was making
his rounds on the succeeding day in the Milwaukee
train.</p>

<p>"Come here, my boy. Let me see what you have
got."</p>

<p>The speaker was an elderly gentleman, with gray
hair and beard, tall and portly. His handsome suit
of the finest broadcloth, the solid gold chain, as thick
almost as a cable, that spanned his waistcoat, and his
general air, indicated prosperity and wealth.</p>

<p>Paul recognized him as a frequent traveler on his
train. He even knew his name, and was aware that
he was a substantial Chicago manufacturer, who had a
branch establishment at Milwaukee.</p>

<p>The name of Alexander Bradford was well known
in business circles, and his name was at any time good
at the bank where he dealt for a hundred thousand
dollars, while the sum of his wealth was generally estimated
at considerably over a million.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>"Certainly, Mr. Bradford," answered Paul, politely,
as he approached the rich man with alacrity.</p>

<p>"Ha, you know my name," said Mr. Bradford.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir; I have seen you often on the
train."</p>

<p>"I can return the compliment, my young friend,"
said Bradford, smiling, "but I am not familiar with
your name."</p>

<p>"My name is not quite so well known as yours,
Mr. Bradford. I am Paul Palmer, at your service!"</p>

<p>"Paul Palmer! The name sounds very well, my
boy. Some day it may be well known, too. I was
not very conspicuous myself at your age. Come,
now, how much do you manage to earn in the course
of a week?"</p>

<p>"I seldom fall short of seven dollars. Sometimes
I get up as high as ten."</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen."</p>

<p>"At your age I was earning about half as much as
you."</p>

<p>"But you didn't depend on it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. I was a poor boy; had to paddle my
own canoe, just as you are doing&mdash;had a mother to
help, too."</p>

<p>"I have a mother and sister to assist," returned
Paul.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>"You don't say so?" Mr. Bradford remarked, surveying
Paul with increased interest. "Then your
father is not living?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"I see you are a good boy. Do you give most of
your wages to your mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you don't think it hard, eh? You don't feel
as if you'd rather spend it on yourself, eh?"</p>

<p>"If my mother didn't need it, I should certainly
like to spend a little more on myself, but I am glad to
feel that I am able to take care of her."</p>

<p>"That's well, my boy; I quite approve of that.
By the way&mdash;it was you, I believe, who caught the
pickpocket that took Miss Dearborn's money?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Were you on the train at the time?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I was in the same car. It did you a great
deal of credit. You are evidently sharp."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't always expect to be a train
boy?"</p>

<p>"I think I shall have to retire by the time I reach
fifty, sir; I can't very well pass for a boy then."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" laughed the old gentleman, appreciating
the joke. "I should say not. And what are you
looking to do in place of it?"</p>

<p>"I should like to get a place in a counting-room or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
store," said Paul; "but at present I couldn't afford to
take such a situation."</p>

<p>"It would lead to more."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but I could not expect at first to earn
more than half as much as I do on the train. While I
have my mother and sister to support, I do not dare to
make a change."</p>

<p>"Very true," said the old gentleman, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Remaining silent, Paul was about to move on,
when Mr. Bradford called him back.</p>

<p>"Stay, my young friend," he said; "I haven't made
a purchase yet."</p>

<p>He selected an illustrated paper and a magazine,
and drew from his vest-pocket a two-dollar bill, which
he handed to our hero.</p>

<p>"Ten and thirty-five are forty-five," said Paul, in a
business-like tone. "I must give you a dollar and
fifty-five cents in change."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Paul," said Mr. Bradford, waving his
hand. "Keep it for yourself, or, rather, give it to
your mother."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Paul, gratefully, for the gift
was equal to his profits for a good day's work.</p>

<p>He was about to resume his walk through the car
when there was a sudden shock.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>Passengers were hurled from their seats; there were
screams of fright and pain, and a confusion hard to
describe.</p>

<p>The train had run off the track!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<small>THE TRAIN-WRECKER.</small></h2></div>


<p>What havoc a single minute&mdash;nay, a half minute,
can make! Here was a train full of passengers, easy
in mind, moving at a speed not beyond the average.
Not a thought of anxiety or apprehension was in the
mind of any. The thought of the pleasant welcome
that awaited them at the end of the journey in the
great city, not more than ten miles away, warmed the
hearts of the travelers, and brought to some faces a
contented smile.</p>

<p>Thirty seconds pass, and the train is a wreck&mdash;the
cars lying on their sides, some of the passengers insensible,
some maimed, a few, alas! dead.</p>

<p>And what has brought all this about?</p>

<p>Half a dozen rails, lying beside the track, have been
placed on it by some fiend, regardless of the suffering
and death he is likely to cause, in order to obtain a
chance to plunder the ill-fated passengers. Such men
are scoundrels for whom hanging would be too good.</p>

<p>Among those who suffered least was the train boy.
He was partially stunned, but almost immediately recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
his consciousness and his wits. He sprang to
his feet and looked around him. The boy, unaccustomed
to scenes of suffering, shuddered as he saw the
mutilated victims of the latest railway horror. The
groans which he heard pierced his heart, and he could
scarcely forbear groaning. Here lay a mother and
her child, both dead, the child's dead hand closely
grasping the hand of the mother who could neither
help him nor herself. But I do not propose to harrow
up the soul of the reader by an enumeration of
the terrible scene. I am chiefly interested in giving
an account of what has a bearing upon our hero and
his history.</p>

<p>While Paul, scarcely recovered from his bewilderment,
was looking about him, his attention was drawn
to a sight that stirred his indignation.</p>

<p>Lying upon his back close by was Alexander Bradford,
the rich manufacturer. He was breathing heavily,
but appeared insensible. Bending over him was an
ill-looking man, with an expression of covetous greed,
coolly engaged in rifling the pockets of the helpless
victim.</p>

<p>It was not a passenger. Paul knew that at a glance,
for he had repeatedly gone through the train, and his
memory of faces was excellent.</p>

<p>"That man wrecked the train, or had something to
do with it," Paul instantly concluded, "and now he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
gathering in his harvest. I will take the liberty of interfering
with his little game."</p>



<p>He looked about for a weapon, and had not far to
look. A piece of wood from the <i>debris</i> of the broken
train furnished him a convenient club. He did not
like to use it till he had given the train-wrecker warning,
however.</p>

<p>"Stop your villainous work!" he exclaimed, with
honest indignation.</p>

<p>The robber looked up suddenly, but seeing only a
boy, recovered his audacity.</p>

<p>"Mind your business, boy," he answered. "I know
what I'm about."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Paul, resolutely, "and I order you
to stop."</p>

<p>"You do, hey? I'll break your head, young man,
and pay you well for your impudence."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p177.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">Paul brought down his club on the man's arm with such force that
he howled with pain.</p>

<p>He had the prostrate manufacturer's pocket-book in
his hand as he spoke, and was about transferring it to
his pocket, when Paul, perceiving that no time was to
be lost, brought down his club on the man's arm with
such force that he howled with pain and dropped the
pocket-book, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"You've broken my arm, you young vagabond!
I'll kill you for that!"</p>

<p>But he was in too great pain to set about it at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
He began to nurse his injured arm, casting the while
black looks of hatred at the intrepid train boy.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Bradford opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he asked, in a bewildered voice.</p>

<p>Paul bent over him, and asked, anxiously:</p>

<p>"Are you much hurt, Mr. Bradford?"</p>

<p>"Is it you, my boy. Tell me where I am."</p>

<p>"An accident has happened. The train ran off
the track."</p>

<p>"I understand now. It was all so sudden. I was
reading, and must have become unconscious."</p>

<p>"Are you hurt? Are any of your limbs broken,
sir?" asked Paul, anxiously.</p>

<p>As Paul was bending over Mr. Bradford, the boy saw
a quick expression of terror on the rich man's face.</p>

<p>"Look out!" he said, in agitation.</p>

<p>Paul, instinctively guessing that the danger came
from the villain he had foiled, sprang aside just in time
to avoid a terrible blow which had been aimed at his
head by the very club he had himself used. The blow
falling on empty air, by its very impetuosity upset the
wretch who sought to inflict it, and he tumbled prone
over the body of Bradford.</p>

<p>But he had made a serious mistake. The engineer
of the train, a man of immense strength, had seen the
abortive attempt, and he sprang forward.</p>

<p>When the train-wrecker was attempting to rise, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
found himself seized by the collar by an iron hand.
He was jerked to his feet with a power against which
he was powerless to contend, and shaken till his bones
seemed to rattle.</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do, you rascal?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Stop shaking me, and I will tell you," said the
man, sullenly.</p>

<p>"There; now tell me at once," said the engineer,
still grasping him firmly, but ceasing to shake him.</p>

<p>"That boy almost broke my arm," said the train-wrecker,
with a look of furious malice, "and I mean
to get even with him; that's the whole of it."</p>

<p>"No; it isn't quite the whole," said Paul. "What
were you doing when I struck you?"</p>

<p>"Taking care of this man."</p>

<p>"Taking care of him!" retorted the train boy, in a
tone of sarcasm. "I'll tell you how he was taking
care of him, Mr. Barnes; he was rifling his pockets."</p>

<p>"You lie!" said the man, ferociously.</p>

<p>"I tell the truth. You had in your hand Mr. Bradford's
wallet, which you had taken from his pocket,
and you were about transferring it to your own."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed the engineer, a sudden light
breaking upon him. "Were you a passenger on this
train?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>"Did you see him, Paul, in your rounds?" asked
the official.</p>

<p>"No. I am sure he was not on the train."</p>

<p>"The boy lies! As if he could remember all the
passengers!"</p>

<p>"Here is a man that will remember," said Paul, as
the conductor came up. "Mr. Bingham, was this
man a passenger?"</p>

<p>The conductor scanned the face of the wrecker, and
promptly answered:</p>

<p>"No. If I had collected fare from him I should
have remembered him."</p>

<p>"I believe this is the man that wrecked the train,"
said the engineer.</p>

<p>"It's a base lie!" exclaimed the train-wrecker, growing
pale, as he saw his crime brought home to him.
"You are all in a conspiracy against me."</p>

<p>As two other passengers came up, the engineer
asked:</p>

<p>"Is there any one here that remembers seeing this
man?"</p>

<p>"I do," said a plain, farmer-looking man, who had
just come up.</p>

<p>"You were not on the train yourself," said the
conductor, suspiciously, thinking it was one of the
wrecker's confederates.</p>

<p>"Of course I wasn't," was the prompt reply. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
was forty rods away, in yonder field. I saw this man
placing the rails on the track, just before the train
came along; and surmising mischief, I hurried to the
road to see if I could signal the train and save it.
But I came too late. The scoundrel had done his
work."</p>

<p>The brawny engineer, at this confirmation of his
suspicions, shook the hapless wrecker as if he would
shake him to pieces, and was about to order him
bound, when a shot from some unknown quarter
penetrated the forehead of the villain, and with a half-uttered
cry he fell to the earth.</p>

<p>Who fired the fatal shot was never discovered, but
only two rods away stood a tall man, rough in aspect,
who looked like a Western hunter. He stood motionless
and impassive, but it was generally supposed that
it was he who dealt swift retribution to the fiend whose
success only brought him death. It was felt that his
fate was deserved, and no troublesome inquiries were
made. No one could pity the wretch who died amid
the ruin he had wrought.</p>

<small>PAUL CHANGES HIS BUSINESS.</small></h2></div>


<p>The shooting of the train-wrecker for the moment
diverted notice from the victims of the catastrophe;
but their condition speedily recalled the attention of
those who were unhurt.</p>

<p>Paul once more bent over Mr. Bradford, and repeated
his inquiry:</p>

<p>"Are you much hurt, Mr. Bradford?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you. I will try to get up, if you will
help me."</p>

<p>With some difficulty, for the manufacturer was a
heavy man, Paul raised him to a sitting position.</p>

<p>"Oh, my arm!" cried Mr. Bradford, wincing.</p>

<p>Paul noticed that his left arm hung helpless at
his side.</p>

<p>"I must have broken my arm," he said; "I can't
raise it."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," said Paul, his voice showing that
he was sincere.</p>

<p>"It is not a time for regret, since I have escaped a
more serious peril. I feel that I am fortunate in comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
with some of these poor people. Never mind
me, Paul; go and see whom you can help."</p>

<p>Paul did as he was directed, and rendered effectual
assistance. I am sure my readers will not wish me to
go into details, but prefer that I should confine myself
to what has direct bearing upon Paul and his
fortunes.</p>

<p>When Paul found time he came again to Mr. Bradford's
side.</p>

<p>"Paul," he said, "have you heard whether a train
has been sent for to carry us to the city?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Bradford. One will be here in half an
hour."</p>

<p>"I am afraid of taking cold in my arm. Is there a
house near by?"</p>

<p>The farmer already introduced overheard the question,
and said:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, my house is near at hand."</p>

<p>"My good friend," said the manufacturer, "can
you arrange to keep me over night? I fear I may
take cold here, and my arm is already feeling stiff.
Of course I will see you compensated for your
trouble."</p>

<p>"Whether you do or not, you are welcome to stay
at my house."</p>

<p>"Paul, I want you to stay with me if you will,"
said Mr. Bradford. "We will telegraph to both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
our families that we are safe, so that the news of the
accident need not terrify them."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I shall be glad to stay with you, if
I can let mother know that no harm has befallen
me."</p>

<p>"Is there a telegraph office near?"</p>

<p>"At the next station, only a quarter of a mile
distant."</p>

<p>"Then after you have seen about my removal, will
you telegraph for me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you money with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, plenty for that purpose."</p>

<p>"Very well. Keep an account of what you spend,
and I will repay you. Charge me with the expense of
both telegrams."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>Paul attended to his errand, and in half an hour
Mrs. Palmer received the following message:</p>



<p class="blockquot">"An accident has happened, but I am safe. I shall not
return to-night. Am taking care of a gentleman who is hurt.</p>

<p class="blockquotright"><span class="smcap">"Paul</span>."</p>

<p>Fortunately this was the first intelligence Paul's
mother received of the railroad disaster, so that she
had no time to feel frightened. Had she heard the
boys crying the extra containing an account of the accident,
she would have been in terrible suspense.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>"Heaven be thanked," she ejaculated, devoutly,
"that my boy has been preserved!"</p>

<p>She sent out Grace to buy an extra as soon as
it appeared, and shuddered as she read the terrible
details.</p>

<p>Stephen, too, read the paper, but he could not tell
whether Paul was hurt, for no list of names was as yet
transmitted.</p>

<p>"Why, that's Paul's train!" he soliloquized. "Ten
to one he's killed or wounded. I don't want him
killed, but if he's only broken a limb, it may teach
him a lesson."</p>

<p>What the lesson was, Stephen did not specify, and
it might have been hard to say why his young
brother needed a lesson, unless it had been criminal
in him to work diligently to support his mother
and sister. He had declined to contribute to the support
of an able-bodied brother, and my readers may
be inclined to think with me that he was quite justified
in that.</p>

<p>Stephen bought a later edition of the paper, and
eagerly scanned the list of casualties.</p>

<p>"I don't see his name," he muttered. "Well, he
always was lucky, while I had all the bad luck.
Humph! things don't seem to be distributed very
equally in this world. However, I'm getting along
pretty well now," Stephen concluded, complacently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>Meanwhile Paul, as well as Mr. Bradford, was installed
in the best bedroom at the farm-house. A
local doctor set the arm, and Paul lay on a lounge,
ready to answer any calls. He was prompt and attentive,
and Mr. Bradford congratulated himself on having
secured so attentive a nurse.</p>

<p>"Paul," said Mr. Bradford the next morning, "you
have been of great service to me."</p>

<p>"I am glad I have been able to, sir," answered
Paul.</p>

<p>"You are a good boy."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"How much did you tell me you earned on the
train?"</p>

<p>"Seldom less than seven dollars. One week I
made as high as ten."</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen."</p>

<p>"That is very good pay for a boy of your age."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I don't know any other employment
that would give me as much."</p>

<p>"But of course you must give it up sooner or
later."</p>

<p>"I thought of that, sir."</p>

<p>"Will you be sorry?"</p>

<p>"Only because when I take a position elsewhere I
must make up my mind to earn considerably less, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
I can't see my way clear to do it while my mother and
sister are so dependent upon me."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know that I am a rich man?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I have always heard so," answered Paul,
not quite understanding why Mr. Bradford should
say it.</p>

<p>"I have always held that a rich man owes a debt to
the world, and should try to liquidate it by doing all
the good in his power."</p>

<p>"I am afraid all rich men don't feel so," said
Paul.</p>

<p>"No; riches are apt to harden the heart, while
they should soften it. I am glad to think that there
are many who feel with me. But to return to your
prospects. I infer that if you were offered a position
paying you as well as this train service you would
accept it. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How much do you make on an average?"</p>

<p>"Daily or weekly, sir?"</p>

<p>"Weekly."</p>

<p>Paul considered a moment, and answered:</p>

<p>"Eight dollars."</p>

<p>"Very good; then I will give you a chance to
better yourself. I will take you into my employ,
dating from yesterday."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>"And give me eight dollars a week?" asked Paul,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Ten dollars. I want you to better yourself, you
know."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, sir," said Paul, gratefully,
"but I am afraid I can't earn as much as that."</p>

<p>"Possibly not. Few boys of your age are worth as
much. But you rendered me yesterday a great service.
You saved me from robbery. How much now
do you think my wallet contained?"</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars," guessed Paul, to whom that
seemed a considerable sum for a man to carry
about.</p>

<p>"Over two thousand!" answered Mr. Bradford,
quietly.</p>

<p>Paul's face showed the amazement he felt.</p>

<p>"Isn't it imprudent to carry round so much?"
he suggested.</p>

<p>"I had the amount paid me in Milwaukee, in bills,
and had no resource but to take it in that form. But
for you that wretch would have got off safely with it.
You see, therefore, that you have saved me more than
enough to pay your wages for two years, even on the
liberal scale I suggest."</p>

<p>"I was very fortunate to fall in with you, Mr. Bradford.
It has given me the opening I have wanted for
a long time."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>"I hope it may prove fortunate for both of us.
Consider yourself, then, already in my employ. After
breakfast I shall send you to Chicago for my own physician,
under whose care I hope myself to go thither
this afternoon."</p>

<small>MR. BRADFORD'S OFFICE.</small></h2></div>


<p>Mr. Bradford was removed to Chicago in the afternoon,
and at his luxurious house was considerably
better off than in the farmer's best chamber.</p>

<p>He had to keep his room for three or four weeks,
but the fracture was not a serious one, and though confined
to the house he was on the whole very comfortable
for a sick man. His sickness did not interfere
with, nor delay the carrying out of his promise to
Paul. He arranged to have the train boy enter his
service immediately, and to that end, on the morning
after his removal, dispatched Paul to his counting-house
with a verbal message to his book-keeper that
Paul was to be employed there.</p>

<p>"It happens," he said to Paul, "that I have really
a vacancy for a boy. The one I have hitherto employed,
and who is in fact still in my employ, is to
prepare for college in accordance with the wishes of a
wealthy uncle, who has offered to defray his expenses,
and it is understood that I will release him as soon as
I can suit myself with another boy."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>"That is lucky for me," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Yes, things happen favorably for you."</p>

<p>"I hope I shall be able to perform my duties to
your satisfaction," said Paul.</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it. There is nothing very difficult,
and John (the present boy) can in a single day give
you all the information you need. By the by, Mr.
Manson, the book-keeper, will be somewhat disappointed,
as he wanted the place for his nephew."</p>

<p>"I don't like to stand in the way of any other boy,"
said Paul, considerately.</p>

<p>"You will not. This nephew&mdash;Julius Clay&mdash;I happen
to know is an unreliable boy, who is disobedient
at home, and would not give me satisfaction. In any
event I wouldn't take him."</p>

<p>"Won't Mr. Manson be prejudiced against me?"
asked Paul.</p>

<p>"He has no right to be. I am under no obligations
to employ a boy I have no confidence in, however
nearly related he may be to Mr. Manson. In
any event I shall be your friend, and I am inclined
to think that will be sufficient to save you from annoyance."</p>

<p>Nevertheless Paul, who had some knowledge of
human nature, felt sorry that his entrance at the office
was likely to prove disagreeable to a man occupying so
important a position as the book-keeper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>"However, Mr. Bradford is my friend," he said to
himself, "and I won't trouble myself."</p>

<p>Mr. Manson had, of course, heard of his employer's
narrow escape from death, and he had gone up to
congratulate him, but had not actually seen him, Mr.
Bradford at the time being asleep. He knew nothing
of the details of the casualty, except what he had read
in the daily papers, and was quite ignorant of Paul's
existence even. He therefore had no warning of the
engagement which was to bring disappointment to
him and his nephew.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock in the morning&mdash;for Paul had
previously called by appointment at Mr. Bradford's
house&mdash;our hero entered that gentleman's counting-room.</p>

<p>Sitting on a high stool was a tall, thin, sallow-complexioned
man, who looked to be rather over thirty
years of age.</p>

<p>This was Emanuel Manson, the book-keeper.</p>

<p>To do him justice it must be admitted that Mr.
Manson was an excellent book-keeper. He understood
his business thoroughly, and was rapid and
accurate. Personally Mr. Bradford had never liked
him, but he appreciated his abilities, and did not allow
personal feeling to interfere with retaining him.</p>

<p>"Business is business, and friendship is friendship,"
the manufacturer said to himself. "There is many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
man whom I would like better, who yet might prove
very inefficient in my business. I should be foolish to
discharge Manson."</p>

<p>So Mr. Manson was likely to retain his place so
long as he did not offend his employer in any inexcusable
way. Mr. Bradford was a mild man, but when
he was roused he could act with decision.</p>

<p>Mr. Manson turned on his stool as Paul entered.</p>

<p>"Well, boy, what do you want?" he asked, in a
manner that could not be considered affable.</p>

<p>"Is this Mr. Manson?" asked Paul, removing his
hat.</p>

<p>"Yes. Why?" demanded the book-keeper, curtly.</p>

<p>"I come from Mr. Bradford," said our hero.</p>

<p>"Well, deliver your message, and don't take up my
time unnecessarily."</p>

<p>Paul felt that he should dislike him, but answered,
politely:</p>

<p>"He has engaged me as office-boy."</p>

<p>"Engaged <i>you</i>!" exclaimed the book-keeper, frowning.
"Who are you?"</p>

<p>It was hard to answer politely, but Paul did.</p>

<p>"My name is Paul Palmer," he said, composedly.</p>

<p>"And where did you fall in with Mr. Bradford,
pray?"</p>

<p>Paul felt that the book-keeper had no business to
ask these questions, but he resolved that, so far as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
was concerned, there should be nothing to complain
of, and he responded in the same tone as before:</p>

<p>"On the train."</p>

<p>"And what were you doing on the train, if I may
inquire?"</p>

<p>"Selling papers and magazines."</p>

<p>"Oh! a train boy!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been in a position before?"</p>

<p>"Not in an office."</p>

<p>"What under heaven could induce Mr. Bradford to
engage you?" asked the book-keeper, irritably.</p>

<p>"I must refer you to Mr. Bradford himself," answered
Paul, with dignity.</p>

<p>"I shall certainly speak to Mr. Bradford on the
subject," said Mr. Manson, significantly. "I am inclined
to think there is some mistake. We have a boy
already."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradford told me he wished to leave, and that
in a day he would initiate me into my duties."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradford has about the same as engaged
another boy," said the book-keeper, with increasing
irritability. "He must have forgotten it."</p>

<p>"I shall be ready to make way for him whenever
Mr. Bradford says the word," said Paul, quietly.</p>

<p>Manson was surprised and displeased to find Paul
so calm. It was easy to see that he was not a boy who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
would allow himself to be bullied or trodden upon.
Mr. Manson already hated him for that. He was
a natural tyrant, and liked to see boys quail under
his displeasure. The present boy was a mild, good-natured
boy, whom he could easily make nervous.
Indeed, John Graves was a boy more fond of study
than business, and he hailed the termination of his
engagement with the more pleasure, because Mr.
Manson found so much fault, and gave him so much
discomfort.</p>

<p>At that moment John entered. He naturally looked
inquiringly at Paul, but he addressed himself to the
book-keeper.</p>

<p>"Here is the mail, Mr. Manson," he said.</p>

<p>"Why weren't you gone a week for it?" snarled the
book-keeper.</p>

<p>"I went as fast as I could, sir," said John, troubled.</p>

<p>"Didn't you stop to play on the way?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Humph! When I was a boy I could do twice as
much in a given time as you. Here is a boy who has
been sent to take your place&mdash;<i>for the present</i>."</p>

<p>These last words were pronounced with an emphasis
which Paul understood, though John did not. He
only heard what he considered to be the intelligence
of his own release.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>"Then can I go?" he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"No; you are to remain through the day to instruct
this new boy in his duties."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Go to the bank with these checks, and you, whatever
your name is, can go with him."</p>

<p>When the two boys were in the street, John asked,
pleasantly:</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Paul Palmer. And yours?"</p>

<p>"John Graves. So you are going to be my successor?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I hope you are not sorry to go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am delighted. Now I can go to school,
and get away from old Manson. But I suppose I
ought not to say anything against him to you."</p>

<p>"I have had a little specimen of his manners. He
doesn't seem to like my coming into the office."</p>

<p>"No; he wanted the place for his nephew, Julius
Clay."</p>

<p>"Do you know Julius?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he's just such another as his uncle in temper,
but not in ability. Mr. Manson is an excellent
book-keeper, but Julius would make a poor office-boy.
Do you think you can stand the book-keeper's
temper?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>"I will get along with him as well as I can," answered
Paul. "Mr. Bradford is my friend."</p>

<p>"That is good; but you'll hate old Manson before
the end of a week."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<small>SERVING A TYRANT.</small></h2></div>


<p>If Paul was prejudiced against the book-keeper
thus early, Mr. Manson was not prepossessed in his
favor. He would have been prejudiced against any
boy who was selected to fill the place he designed for
his nephew, but besides this there was an indefinable
something in Paul's air and manner that led him to
anticipate difficulty in maintaining his authority.</p>

<p>"I shall have trouble with that boy, I'm thinking,"
he said to himself, with a vicious stab of the pen in
the unoffending paper before him. "Well, that will
be bad for him, I reckon. He looks like a mighty independent
young vagabond. I shall have to take him
in training."</p>

<p>The duties of Paul's new place were not difficult to
learn. He didn't need to be shown the way to the
post-office, or bank, and he was as well acquainted
with the streets and localities of Chicago as any boy
had occasion to be.</p>

<p>So when the day was over, he bade a friendly good-night
to John Graves with the remark:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>"I guess I can get along by myself now, John, but
I hope to see you sometimes."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Paul. I hope you will get along
with the book-keeper."</p>

<p>"I will try to," answered Paul. "That is, I will do
all I can reasonably be expected to, but I shall not allow
him to run over me."</p>

<p>"He'll make the attempt, you may be sure of
that."</p>

<p>"By the way, John, do you mind telling me how
much pay you have received&mdash;how much a week, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Four dollars a week for the first six months.
Then I was promoted to five, though the book-keeper
tried hard to prevent it."</p>

<p>"If you had been his nephew it would have been
different."</p>

<p>"Oh, he would have given Julius five dollars, perhaps
six, to start with."</p>

<p>"Very likely."</p>

<p>Paul was glad John did not ask him how much he
was to receive, as it would have been difficult to explain
why he should be so favored. In fact, John supposed
no bargain had been made, and that Paul had
questioned him in order to ascertain what he was himself
likely to be paid.</p>

<p>Paul presented himself the next morning at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
office at the usual hour, which he had been told was
eight o'clock.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, sir!" he said to the book-keeper,
who had just arrived.</p>

<p>"Humph, you're late!" said Manson, sourly.</p>

<p>Just then a public clock struck eight, and the
strokes were audible to both.</p>

<p>"Not by that clock, Mr. Manson," said Paul, significantly.</p>

<p>"Humph! that clock's always slow."</p>

<p>Paul did not think it necessary to answer.</p>

<p>"Well, go to work! Don't stand idling there!" said
Manson, sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, if you will let me know what to do," said
Paul, not in the least nervous.</p>

<p>"Dust off my desk, and be quick about it."</p>

<p>Paul did as he was directed.</p>

<p>"Now go to the post-office. Wait, here is the key
to our box."</p>

<p>Paul went and returned immediately, making unusually
good time, but it is easy for an unreasonable
man to find fault, if he has fully made up his mind to
do so.</p>

<p>"What made you so long?" demanded the book-keeper,
irascibly.</p>

<p>Paul was provoked, and had no hesitation in showing
his sense of the book-keeper's unreasonableness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>"Because I haven't wings, or seven league boots,"
he answered, coolly.</p>

<p>"How do you dare speak thus to me?" demanded
Manson, in a rage.</p>

<p>"Because, sir, neither you nor any one else can
make better time without running."</p>

<p>As Paul said this, he looked Mr. Manson in the
eye, and Manson saw that the boy did not mean to be
imposed upon. But he did not propose to relinquish
his habit of finding fault readily.</p>

<p>"That's gammon!" he said; "I know what boys
are like. They all waste time."</p>

<p>"I don't," answered Paul, briefly.</p>

<p>"Don't be impudent."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, don't be unreasonable."</p>

<p>"I have a good mind to discharge you on the spot,"
said the book-keeper.</p>

<p>"As you please, sir. If Mr. Bradford sustains you,
I shall make no request to remain."</p>

<p>Manson felt that he had not come out of the controversy
best. Paul exhibited a coolness and composure
that surprised and annoyed him.</p>

<p>"He won't stay here long, if I can help it," he said
to himself. "Why, he actually defies me."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Paul's quiet resolution made him more
wary in his dealings with Paul, as he did not like to
run the risk of defeat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>"You can take this note to Mr. Bradford," he said,
an hour later.</p>

<p>He would have preferred to send some one else, for
he did not care that Paul should have an opportunity
of getting into the good graces of his employer; but
he had no choice. This was the boy's duty, and no
one else could be spared.</p>

<p>The note related to business on which Mr. Bradford
would expect to be consulted.</p>

<p>"Take that," he said, "and come back some time
to-day."</p>

<p>"I shall come back as soon as Mr. Bradford releases
me."</p>

<p>"Take care you do."</p>

<p>All this was very annoying, and, indeed, insulting,
but Paul was judicious, and, while resisting aggression
and injustice, knew that he could not make Mr. Manson
civil or polite.</p>

<p>Arrived at the house of Mr. Bradford, Paul was
shown into the presence of the manufacturer.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Paul!" said Mr. Bradford, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, sir. I have come with a note
from Mr. Manson."</p>

<p>Mr. Bradford took it and read it quickly. He took
out a pencil and wrote at the bottom a couple of
lines.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>"That is my answer," he said, returning it to Paul.</p>

<p>"How do you like Mr. Manson?" asked the manufacturer.</p>

<p>"Not very well, sir."</p>

<p>"I suppose he does not appear to like you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; it is very clear he does not."</p>

<p>Paul stopped there.</p>

<p>"Have you any complaints to make?" asked Mr.
Bradford.</p>

<p>"No, sir; I don't care to say anything; but I would
like to ask you a favor."</p>

<p>"What is it, Paul?"</p>

<p>"If Mr. Manson makes any complaints against
me, will you give me an opportunity to defend myself?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I will. Do you apprehend that he will
complain of you?"</p>

<p>"I am pretty sure he will."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He seems determined to find fault with me. However,
I shall not be the first to complain. I propose
to do my duty faithfully, and will bear his scolding as
well as I can. If I suit you, sir, I shall be satisfied.
I don't expect to suit Mr. Manson."</p>

<p>"Well said, Paul. I won't inquire into your relations
with the book-keeper, but if he complains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
you, you may rest assured that I will give you a
chance to defend yourself."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; that is all I ask."</p>

<p>Paul returned to the office, and when, as he expected,
Mr. Manson charged him with loitering on the
way, he heard him with a cool contempt, which angered
the book-keeper more than spoken words.</p>

<p>"Really, this is the most impertinent boy we ever
had in the office. He does not seem to mind me any
more than if I was a porter."</p>

<p>Accustomed to have boys quail before him, he was
provoked at the coolness with which Paul bore his
taunts and reproaches, and he felt all the more resolved
either to get him dismissed, or to make him
anxious to resign.</p>

<p>Among other things, he was accustomed to employ
the office-boy to run on his private errands, though, of
course, wholly unauthorized to do so, and he expected
to employ Paul in the same manner.</p>

<p>About three o'clock he summoned Paul, and said to
him:</p>

<p>"You may go to my room, No. 47 H&mdash;&mdash; street,
and ask my landlady to give you a bundle of dirty
clothes, which you will carry to the laundry, No. 18
M&mdash;&mdash; street."</p>

<p>Paul looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Are the clothes Mr. Bradford's?" he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>"No, you little fool, they are mine."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, I must decline to take them. I am in
Mr. Bradford's employ, not yours."</p>

<p>"Do you decline to do as I bid you?" gasped Manson,
at white heat.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I am not employed to do any such
work."</p>

<p>"You'll repent this!" exclaimed the book-keeper,
mortified and incensed. "It seems you defy my
authority."</p>

<p>"No, sir; I shall do whatever you have a right to
demand of me."</p>

<p>"I'll have you out of this office before the end of
the week. See if I don't."</p>

<p>Paul walked away, not appearing in the least terrified
by this threat.</p>

<small>MR. MANSON IS SURPRISED.</small></h2></div>


<p>Emanuel Manson felt too late that he had made a
mistake. He had intended to humiliate Paul by
making him his own errand boy, but our hero's firm
refusal to serve him made the humiliation his own.
He did not venture to report the matter to Mr. Bradford,
for he knew that he had no right to call upon
Paul to do his own errands; yet to let it pass would
seem like a confession of weakness.</p>

<p>"I can't do anything at present," he decided, "but
I will take the first opportunity to prejudice Mr. Bradford
against the young rascal and procure his dismissal."</p>

<p>In other words, Mr. Manson proposed to bide his
time. He had no idea of foregoing his vengeance,
but thought it politic to defer it. Meanwhile he had
plenty of opportunities to make things disagreeable to
Paul, and availed himself of them.</p>

<p>At the end of the first week a very disagreeable surprise
awaited Mr. Manson.</p>

<p>The time came to pay off the clerks, and among
others Paul.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>He drew from the cash-box four dollars and handed
it to our hero, with the remark:</p>

<p>"There's your pay, though it is more than you have
earned."</p>

<p>Paul glanced at the two two-dollar bills which lay
in his hand, and said, quietly:</p>

<p>"Why do you pay me four dollars?"</p>

<p>"Three would be enough, but I didn't suppose you
would be modest enough to admit it."</p>

<p>"I am not. I suppose Mr. Bradford hasn't told
you how much my wages are to be."</p>

<p>"How much?" inquired the book-keeper, with a
sneer. "Ten dollars, I presume."</p>

<p>"You are right. I will trouble you to give me six
dollars more."</p>

<p>"Are you crazy?" gasped Manson.</p>

<p>"Not that I am aware of," answered Paul, coolly.</p>

<p>"If you are trying to humbug me, you may as well
give up the attempt. I wasn't born last year."</p>

<p>"I am neither crazy nor trying to humbug you,"
said Paul, with easy self-possession. "Mr. Bradford
has kindly agreed to pay me ten dollars a week,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never heard a more outrageous falsehood!"
ejaculated Manson. "The idea of paying a raw, inexperienced
boy ten dollars a week! Why, it is utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
ridiculous. I shall take care to report your attempted
swindle to Mr. Bradford."</p>

<p>"Just as you like, Mr. Manson; but first, will you
cast your eyes over this note?"</p>

<p>Paul produced a folded sheet of note-paper, and
passed it to the book-keeper.</p>

<p>Manson read to his amazement these words over the
signature of Alexander Bradford:</p>


<p class="blockquot">"I have fixed the wages of Paul Palmer at ten dollars per
week, and you are authorized to pay him that sum."</p>

<p>"Where did you get this paper?" asked Manson.</p>

<p>"From Mr. Bradford."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday. He thought you would require his
authority for paying so large a sum."</p>

<p>"How do I know but you have forged this note?"
asked Manson.</p>

<p>"Probably you know Mr. Bradford's handwriting
and signature. Besides, it would be foolish in me to
attempt a forgery which would immediately be found
out."</p>

<p>In fact, Manson knew that the note was genuine.
He could not be mistaken in Mr. Bradford's handwriting,
but he wanted to find some excuse for delaying
or refusing payment. On the whole, he did not
venture to do either, as he knew his employer would
be offended.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>"There's your money," he said, throwing the balance
on the desk. "I can't say I understand it at all.
I shall feel it necessary to speak to Mr. Bradford on
the subject."</p>

<p>"I wish you would, sir, so as to remove any doubts
you may have."</p>

<p>"It is about three times as much as you have
earned."</p>

<p>"I won't dispute you, sir. I am quite aware that
it is more than I can earn."</p>

<p>"Then why did Mr. Bradford pay you so much?"</p>

<p>"Probably he will tell you when you speak to him
on the subject."</p>

<p>Manson was baffled, but he felt all the more annoyed
that his nephew Julius had lost a situation
which carried so much pay with it.</p>

<p>He dispatched Paul on an errand, and during his
absence Julius came in.</p>

<p>"Well, Julius," said his uncle, "I have just been
paying that boy who has got your place."</p>

<p>"I wish you had been paying me. I haven't got
a cent to my name. Four dollars would have come
mighty convenient."</p>

<p>"Four dollars!"</p>

<p>"Yes; isn't that what he gets? Three dollars
would be too mean."</p>

<p>"The boy gets <i>ten dollars</i> a week!"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>"Ten dollars!" gasped Julius. "Oh, come now,
you're fooling."</p>

<p>"Not at all. Do you see that?"</p>

<p>He showed Julius the note of Mr. Bradford previously
referred to.</p>

<p>"Good gracious! I can't believe it!" exclaimed
Julius. "Why, it's tremendous pay. Can't you turn
him off and get me in his place? What a swell I'd
cut on ten dollars a week!"</p>

<p>"I wish you had the place," said Manson, thoughtfully;
"but I don't know how to manage it."</p>

<p>"Try to think of some way, Uncle Emanuel,"
pleaded Julius. "I should have liked it at four, for
ma only gives me a dollar a week allowance, and that
is hardly enough to buy my cigarettes."</p>

<p>"You'd be a good deal better off if you gave up
cigarettes. They are doing you no good."</p>

<p>And here Mr. Manson gave his nephew good advice.</p>

<p>"Put me in the place, and I'll do whatever you
want me to," said Julius.</p>

<p>"I'll do my part," said the book-keeper.</p>

<small>THE BOOK-KEEPER'S TRIUMPH.</small></h2></div>


<p>In less time than was anticipated Mr. Bradford
came to the office, his arm being so far well that it no
longer gave him any trouble.</p>

<p>The book-keeper did not delay long to open his
batteries upon Paul. On the second day, our hero being
out, Manson began:</p>

<p>"I would like to say a few words to you, Mr. Bradford,
about the new boy."</p>

<p>"About Paul?" asked Mr. Bradford, lifting his eyes
from the morning paper.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well, proceed."</p>

<p>"I can't say I am satisfied with him, sir."</p>

<p>"Indeed! What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"He is not respectful to me."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"I may say he is positively impudent at times."</p>

<p>"That surprises me. He seems to me very unlikely
to be guilty of such offenses."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>"I dare say; he is very artful. I presume he is
very respectful to you. That is policy."</p>

<p>"I should suppose he would consider it politic to
be respectful to you also, Mr. Manson."</p>

<p>"All the other boys have, but this boy puts on a
great many airs. In fact, he is mighty independent.
I suppose it is on account of the extremely high wages
he receives."</p>

<p>"Yes, ten dollars is very high pay for a boy of his
age," admitted Mr. Bradford.</p>

<p>"Of course he doesn't earn it. He doesn't earn
half as much."</p>

<p>"You may be right. I should not be inclined to
pay another boy nearly as much."</p>

<p>Mr. Manson was sorry to hear this, as, could he
obtain the position for Julius at ten dollars a week, his
young nephew had agreed to pay him a commission of
two dollars a week, which the book-keeper, being fond
of money, was not above accepting.</p>

<p>"Have you any other complaints to make about
Paul?" asked Mr. Bradford. "Doesn't he attend to
his duties?"</p>

<p>"Fairly well," Manson admitted, reluctantly, the
fact being that there had never been a boy in the office
so efficient as our hero, the ex-train boy.</p>

<p>"Humph! I am glad to hear that."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>"Still it is of course disagreeable to have a boy
under me who treats me with insolence."</p>

<p>"Do I understand, then, that you would prefer to
have a change?" inquired the manufacturer.</p>

<p>"I don't want to make any trouble, sir," said the
book-keeper, who could be polite enough to his employer,
"but I should really be glad to have another
boy in Paul's place."</p>

<p>"Very well. I have been thinking of making a
change myself."</p>

<p>Manson could hardly believe his ears. He had
entertained very small hope of effecting his purpose,
and Mr. Bradford's ready acquiescence in his wishes
filled him with delight.</p>

<p>"If I might venture the suggestion," he added,
encouraged by his success, "I should be glad if you
would give the place to my nephew Julius."</p>

<p>"I don't know how Julius will suit me," said Mr.
Bradford, "but I will try him for a week."</p>

<p>"At ten dollars a week?" suggested Mr. Manson.</p>

<p>"At <i>four</i> dollars a week!" replied the manufacturer,
with emphasis. "That is all boys of his age
usually get. There were special reasons why I paid
Paul more."</p>

<p>Manson was disappointed that Julius should be paid
only ordinary boys' wages, but still it was a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
triumph to have Paul discharged, and Julius put in
his place.</p>

<p>"Now," he said to himself, "I've the whip-hand of
the young rascal. I'll pay him off."</p>

<p>"Shall I tell him, sir, when he comes in?" asked
the book-keeper.</p>

<p>"No; I propose to tell him myself. Send him in
to me when he gets back from his errand."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I will," promptly responded the book-keeper,
resuming his own work with a satisfied smile.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Paul came in from the post office,
bringing the afternoon mail.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX.<br />

<small>PAUL IS PROMOTED.</small></h2></div>


<p>"You are to go to Mr. Bradford at once," said
Manson, as he received the letters Paul had brought.</p>

<p>There was a triumphant smile on the book-keeper's
face which Paul did not fail to observe.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" he thought. "Has he been
complaining of me?"</p>

<p>This would not have troubled him but for Manson's
evident satisfaction. It was clear, he thought, that
something disagreeable was about to happen during
the interview that awaited Paul. However, he did not
propose to give his enemy the satisfaction of knowing
that he had given him anxiety. He merely said in his
usual tone, "Very well, sir," and proceeded to open
the door of the inner office.</p>

<p>"Mr. Manson told me you wished to see me, sir,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Mr. Bradford, wheeling round in
his office chair. "Manson has been making complaints
against you."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised at that, sir. From the first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
he appears to have disliked me. May I ask what he
says?"</p>

<p>"He says you are not respectful to him."</p>

<p>"I am as respectful as I can be, but he is continually
finding fault. It is impossible to please him."</p>

<p>"He wants me to discharge you."</p>

<p>Paul's heart beat quickly. It would be a misfortune
to him to leave so good a place, especially as he was
not sure whether he could regain his place as train
boy, and it would operate against him to have it
known that he had been discharged by Mr. Bradford.</p>

<p>"Of course, sir," he answered, soberly, "that is as
you please."</p>

<p>"Moreover," the manufacturer proceeded, "he
wants me to take his nephew, Julius, in your place."</p>

<p>"I knew he wanted Julius in my place," said Paul,
despondently.</p>

<p>"And I have about made up my mind to let him
try the experiment."</p>

<p>The blow had fallen! Poor Paul thought it hard,
but his pride sustained him. He could not understand,
however, how Mr. Bradford could so desert
him and side with his enemy, the book-keeper.</p>

<p>"Then, sir, I suppose I am to go," he answered.</p>

<p>"Well, I can hardly employ two boys in the office,
since there is not more than work enough for one."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>"I am very sorry, sir," said Paul, in a subdued
tone. "I have tried to be faithful to you."</p>

<p>"And that is the reason why I intend to promote
you," said the manufacturer, smiling.</p>

<p>Promote! The word fell like music on Paul's ears.
It was all right. His friend had not deserted him
after all.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, sir," he said, his face brightening.</p>

<p>"Come now, Paul, you didn't really think I meant
to discharge you, did you?"</p>

<p>"It looked like it, sir," said Paul.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have made you feel so uncomfortable,"
said his employer. "Now about this change. I am
letting Manson have his way only to prove to him
how unfit Julius is for the post. He hasn't tried him
yet. When he does he will find him idle, lazy, and
unreliable, and he will find such fault that his nephew
will probably himself resign the place in disgust."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Paul. "Ten dollars will
reconcile him as it did me."</p>

<p>"Oh, bless your soul! Julius isn't to have ten
dollars. He is to have four, like all his predecessors
except yourself."</p>

<p>On the whole Paul was rather glad of that. It made
Mr. Manson's momentary triumph less important.</p>

<p>"Now about your own affairs," said Mr. Bradford.
"Are you willing to leave Chicago and travel West?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>"I would like it above all things, sir," said Paul,
his eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>"I thought you would. Well, I am about to give
you an important commission. Do you know where
the Black Hills are situated?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; in Wyoming."</p>

<p>"Precisely. Well, I suppose you know that multitudes
have flocked there in search of gold."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I myself own half a mine there. It is known as
the Blackstone. A man named Fox, who is resident
at the mine, owns the other half, and its working is
done under his direction. Now I have a shrewd suspicion
that he is cheating me, taking advantage of my
absence and probable inability to form any adequate
judgment of the mine and its value."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so, sir?"</p>

<p>"His continually writing discouraging accounts of
the mine, expressing his great disappointment with it.
In his last letter he winds up by saying that he is willing
to give or take two thousand dollars for it, though
it cost the two of us ten thousand."</p>

<p>"Doesn't he run a risk in making such an offer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he thinks I can't attend to it myself, and
will sacrifice my interest readily, just to get rid of
anxiety."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>"Now I want you to go out and form a judgment
as to the man's motives, and get an idea of the real
value of the mine."</p>

<p>"But, sir, I don't know anything about mines."</p>

<p>"Very true. Still you have good common sense,
and can institute inquiries without exciting suspicion.
No one would suppose I would select as my agent a
boy of sixteen."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is rash," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Nine out of ten would say so, but somehow I
have more confidence in you than in many men, and
I believe you would serve me faithfully."</p>

<p>"You are right there, sir, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Now as to the compensation. Will twenty-five
dollars a week and your traveling expenses content
you?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five dollars!" ejaculated Paul. "Are you
in earnest?"</p>

<p>"Quite so. Paul, I don't pay you according to
your age, but according to the nature of your work,
and twenty-five dollars a week is not too much. Now,
when can you start?"</p>

<p>"Day after to-morrow, sir."</p>

<p>"That will do."</p>

<p>"I was thinking how I could arrange about my
mother, Mr. Bradford. She will need money while I
am gone."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>"She can call every Saturday at the office and collect
what you thinks she needs. Shall it be ten dollars
a week? If so, it can be deducted from your week's
wages."</p>

<p>"That will be very satisfactory, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. Go home, make preparations for setting
out, and come to me to-morrow for instructions.
Don't tell anybody except your mother where you are
going."</p>

<p>"All right sir."</p>

<p>As Paul entered the presence of the book-keeper,
the latter glanced at him eagerly to see his downcast
looks. He was perplexed to see that Paul seemed
in excellent spirits, and feared Mr. Bradford had
reconsidered his decision. But Paul reassured him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Manson," he said, "I am about to leave
you."</p>

<p>"So Mr. Bradford has found you out, and discharged
you," sneered Manson.</p>

<p>"At any rate," answered Paul, "I shall no longer
be office-boy. Julius is to take my place."</p>

<p>"If you had been more respectful to me you might
have staid," said Manson.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradford didn't say anything about that,"
said Paul, smiling. "Well, good-day."</p>

<p>"There's something about this I don't understand,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
thought the perplexed book-keeper. "I thought
he would make a fuss. Well, at any rate, I've carried
my point. He's bounced, and Julius is in his
place."</p>

<small>PAUL AND HIS SUCCESSOR.</small></h2></div>


<p>About eleven o'clock the next forenoon Paul, after
making some necessary arrangements, took his way
toward Mr. Bradford's counting-room.</p>

<p>As he turned into State street he encountered
Julius, who had already entered upon the duties of
his office. Naturally, Julius adopted his uncle's
theory, that Paul had given dissatisfaction and been
discharged, and, as he bore no good will to our hero,
he was gratified at the thought.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he called out, not averse to exulting over
his predecessor.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Julius," said Paul, affably.</p>

<p>"I've got your place," said Julius, not attempting
to conceal his satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Paul.</p>

<p>"He doesn't seem to mind it," commented Julius
to himself. "I suppose he is too proud to show me
how he feels."</p>

<p>"What did the old man bounce you for?" asked
Julius, rather curious on the subject.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>"You must ask him," said Paul, still pleasantly.</p>

<p>"My uncle always told me you wouldn't stay,"
said Julius.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he got me turned off," suggested Paul.</p>

<p>"I reckon he did. He didn't like you much."</p>

<p>"No; there wasn't much love lost between us."</p>

<p>"Where are you going now?"</p>

<p>"Round to the office."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To see Mr. Bradford."</p>

<p>"If you want him to take you on again," said
Julius, rather uneasily, "you might as well give it up.
He won't do it."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Julius, hurriedly; "my uncle
wouldn't let him do it."</p>

<p>"I thought Mr. Bradford was boss, not your
uncle," Paul ventured to observe.</p>

<p>"He'll let my uncle choose the office-boy, and of
course uncle Emanuel prefers me."</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, Julius. I won't try to deprive
you of your place. Still I want to see Mr. Bradford."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what you want," said Julius, nodding.</p>

<p>"Suppose you tell me?"</p>

<p>"You want Mr. Bradford to give you a recommendation,
so you can get another place."</p>

<p>"You are sharp, Julius," said Paul, laughing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>"It doesn't take much sharpness to see that."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To the post-office."</p>

<p>"Very well. We may meet in the office. Good-morning."</p>

<p>"I don't understand that boy," said Julius to himself.
"Anybody would think he was all right, instead
of having lost his place and a salary of ten dollars a
week. It's awful mean of the old man to pay me
only four. I'm worth as much as Paul any day."</p>

<p>Such was the idea of Julius, and he was by no
means singular in thinking well of himself. That is
rather common among men as well as boys.</p>

<p>Paul went on his way and soon reached the office.</p>

<p>The book-keeper turned his head as he entered.</p>

<p>When his eyes rested on Paul he frowned.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> back again?" he said.</p>

<p>"I am back again, Mr. Manson," replied Paul,
composedly.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Manson, rudely.</p>

<p>"My business is not with you, but with Mr. Bradford,"
answered Paul, coldly.</p>

<p>"It appears to me you have no business whatever
in this office after being discharged," continued Manson.</p>

<p>"It is plain Mr. Bradford doesn't tell you all his
affairs," said Paul.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I am still in Mr. Bradford's employ, though not
as office-boy."</p>

<p>"Is this true?" asked Manson, in a tone of unpleasant
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I am here now by Mr. Bradford's appointment."</p>

<p>The book-keeper's countenance fell. Where now
was his triumph? As the post of office-boy was the
lowest in the establishment, it was clear Paul had been
promoted, and the book-keeper would no longer have
the satisfaction of ordering him about or giving him
annoyance.</p>

<small>JIM SCOTT.</small></h2></div>


<p>By advice of Mr. Bradford, Paul selected the Chicago,
Rock Island, Pacific route to Omaha, where he took
passage on the Union Pacific road as far as Cheyenne,
in the southern part of Wyoming, known as the
"Magic City of the Plains." He was very much interested
in what he saw from the car windows as he
rolled over the prairies of Illinois and the fertile plains
of Iowa. He gazed eagerly at the Mississippi River,
of which he had heard so much, and was somewhat
disappointed to find it so narrow at the point of
crossing.</p>

<p>On again from Omaha, five hundred miles and
over, till the train halted at Cheyenne, and he got out
at the station.</p>

<p>As he stood on the platform, while the train went
on, he was accosted by a roughly dressed man, who
might be a miner to judge from his slouch hat, his
loose-fitting clothes, and his long and rather ragged-looking
beard, which seemed a stranger both to razor
and scissors.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>"Goin' to stop here, young man?"</p>

<p>"I shall stop over to-night, I think," answered
Paul.</p>

<p>"And to-morrow I reckon you go to the Hills?"</p>

<p>"That is my intention," said Paul, guardedly.</p>

<p>"I don't know but I'll go there myself, though I
did calculate to stay here, or hereabouts, for a time."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been to the mines?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"Have I ever been there? Well, I should smile,"
answered the stranger, expectorating profusely. "Why,
I own a hotel in Custer City. I left my cousin in
charge, while I made a run down here to learn the
fashions."</p>

<p>This he said with a grim smile, and a glance at his
rough attire</p>

<p>"Have you found them?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't followed 'em. Where might you
be from, youngster?"</p>

<p>"From Chicago."</p>

<p>"I was there once, long ago, but I drifted on to
California, and lived there up among the mountains
for seven or eight years. Somehow I didn't get rich.
But, one day, I heard of the Black Hills, and dusted
for 'em."</p>

<p>"I hope good luck came to you there," said Paul,
politely.</p>

<p>"You bet it did. Why, youngster, rough as I look,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
I consider myself worth to-day from fifty to a hundred
thousand dollars."</p>

<p>Paul looked at his new acquaintance with respect as
a successful man.</p>

<p>"That is a good deal of money," he said.</p>

<p>"So it is. Sometimes I wake up and forget that
I'm rich. Seems to me I'm the same shiftless vagabond
that lived for years among the California mountains,
but there's a heap of satisfaction in findin' I'm
mistaken."</p>

<p>"So I should think."</p>

<p>"And what's more, I don't mean to gamble away
my pile, as most miners do. I'm gettin' on in life,
and I can't afford it."</p>

<p>"That is where you are sensible," said Paul.</p>

<p>"And now, youngster, if I may be so bold, what's
your name?"</p>

<p>"Paul Palmer."</p>

<p>"That sounds like a story name."</p>

<p>"But it's my real name, for all that."</p>

<p>"Do you expect to make your fortune out there?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I hope to find something to do."</p>

<p>"You're pretty young to be travelin' alone."</p>

<p>"Yes; I am only sixteen."</p>

<p>"Have you got money enough to keep you along
till you get something to do?"</p>

<p>"I think I can get along."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>"If you get into any trouble, just call on Jim Scott&mdash;that's
me&mdash;and I'll see you through."</p>

<p>"Mr. Scott, I am very much obliged to you for
such a kind offer to a stranger."</p>

<p>"<i>Mr.</i> Scott? Oh, you mean me! I'd rather you'd
call me Jim&mdash;it comes more natural."</p>

<p>"Then I say, thank you, Jim," said Paul, offering
his hand.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Mr. Scott, in a tone of satisfaction.
"Now come round to the hotel, and I'll put
you up to a wrinkle or two, and we'll talk over our
trip to Custer City."</p>

<p>"Then you are going, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you don't mind my company."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to have the benefit of your experience."</p>

<p>Paul knew that it behooved him to avoid sudden
acquaintanceships, but there was something in Mr.
Scott's manner, rough as his appearance was, that inspired
confidence.</p>

<small>CHEYENNE.</small></h2></div>


<p>Paul looked about him with eager curiosity, for he
had all a youth's keen zest in visiting unknown places.
He saw one long street, of unusual width, lined with
an indiscriminate variety of buildings from one-story
saloons and offices to two and three-story buildings.</p>

<p>The Inter-Ocean Hotel, in front of which his guide
halted, was a fine brick structure of three stories,
which seemed hardly at home in the loosely built
town, which had sprung up as if by magic on the
prairies.</p>

<p>"This is where I put up," said Mr. Scott.</p>

<p>"I'll take a room here, if they can give me one."</p>

<p>"I'll see that you have one. They know me&mdash;Jim
Scott&mdash;and they'd make room if they hadn't one. Do
you know what they used to call this settlement?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"'Hell on Wheels' was the name they give it in
early days."</p>

<p>"Was that to invite settlers?" asked Paul, laughing.</p>

<p>"I expect it was because it was about the roughest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
most lawless place between Omaha and Frisco. Why
the principal occupation of the first settlers was gamblin',
drinkin' rot-gut whisky, and shootin'. There
wasn't a day passed hardly but some chap was found
lyin' in the street with a hole in his head or a bullet in
his heart. I tell you them was rough times."</p>

<p>"I hope things have changed," said Paul, by no
means prepossessed in favor of Cheyenne by what he
had heard. "If they haven't, I don't think I shall
stay here long."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it's settled down, so that life is pretty
safe. They had to raise a vigilance committee to set
things straight like they did in Frisco. It's all right
now."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it."</p>

<p>Meanwhile they had entered the hotel, and Paul
succeeded in securing a room adjoining that of Mr.
Scott, or Jim Scott, as he insisted on being called.</p>

<p>After he had washed and changed his clothing, he
sat down to a substantial meal, which he enjoyed with
the hearty appetite of youth. Then Mr. Scott invited
him to take a walk about the town.</p>

<p>"I say, youngster, have you got a father and mother?"</p>

<p>"My father is dead, but I have a mother and sister
living."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>"And what did your mother say to your comin' out
here?"</p>

<p>"She was willing, knowing that I had my own way
to make."</p>

<p>"I haven't chick or child myself. I had a wife
once, but she died twenty years ago. Now I've got
money, but sometimes I feel lonely."</p>

<p>"It isn't too late for you to marry again, Mr.
Scott."</p>

<p>"Mr. Scott?"</p>

<p>"I mean Jim."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right, but there ain't many women
would hitch on to me except for my money, and I'm
better without such. I say, youngster, do you mind
my keepin' company with you while you stay in these
parts?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Jim. I shall feel fortunate in having
one with me who knows so much more about the
country than I."</p>

<p>"That's all right, then. When do you want to start
for Custer City?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, if there is a chance."</p>

<p>"Then I'll get ready, too."</p>

<p>"What is the distance?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred and fifty miles, and pretty long
miles, some of 'em."</p>

<p>"Do we travel by stage?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>"Yes. One has been put on lately. When I went
first, I traveled by wagon, and was a week on the road,
maybe ten days. Now, if you travel at night, we can
reach Custer City in forty-eight hours or thereabouts."</p>

<p>"I suppose the road is a lonely one?"</p>

<p>"You may say that. As far as Fort Laramie it is
pretty well settled. There is a ranch about every
twelve miles."</p>

<p>"Do you call that well settled?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jim, "we call it so out here."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think people would feel crowded, living
at such distances."</p>

<p>"We like plenty of room, you see, Paul."</p>

<p>The next morning Paul and his new friend started
for Custer City, and in due time arrived at the Black
Hills metropolis without any adventures that need recording.</p>

<small>MAJOR ASHTON IN A QUANDARY.</small></h2></div>


<p>We must now leave our hero for a time and return
to Chicago, to look after some of the other characters
whom we have introduced in our story.</p>

<p>Major Ashton, after a late breakfast, sat in a handsome
apartment, with several letters before him. These
he had examined without much apparent satisfaction.
Finally he threw down the last with a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"They all sing the same tune," he said, irritably.
"They are all poor trades-people, who want money.
Here's my tailor, who ventures to hope I will call
round and settle his little bill&mdash;two hundred and
seventeen dollars!&mdash;as he is in great want of money.
What business has the rascal to want money? I dare
say he has a plentiful bank account, made by fleecing
customers like myself. Then there's Jones, the boot-maker,
wants me to pay up his bill of sixty-five dollars
for boots and shoes. I can't remember having all the
things he charges for. I dare say the rogue has charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
for what I never had. Then here's my landlady has
left on my table a bill for the last two months' board,
at the rate of thirty-five dollars a week. Really, it
looks as if all my creditors had combined to annoy
me on this particular evening.</p>

<p>"The worst of it is," continued the major, after a
slight pause, "I don't see any way out of the difficulty.
I haven't even money enough to pay my way
in a cheap boarding-house. If I should descend to
such degradation, farewell to all my social position.
Managing mammas would no more angle for me, and
even Miss Framley would turn up her plebeian pug
nose at me, though it would seem as if nature had
saved her the necessity. At present she is trying in
desperate earnest to catch me."</p>

<p>The major was not misled by vanity. Miss Framley
knew very well that the major was regarded as a great
catch, and that a match with him would give her
a distinguished position in society. Moreover, she
was under the mistaken impression that he was
wealthy. The mistake was a natural one. The major
was always arrayed with irreproachable elegance, wore
expensive jewelry, was known to live handsomely, and
indeed to possess all the outward marks of prosperity.
She would gladly have embraced the opportunity to
become Mrs. Major Ashton.</p>

<p>At one time the major thought of giving her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
opportunity. He knew that Framley <i>pere</i> was rich,
and that Miss Framley had fifty thousand dollars in
her own right. How far this money would be at the
command of her husband was an important question.</p>

<p>Miss Framley forever spoiled her chances one day,
when she incautiously expressed the determination to
have her fortune settled on herself. She was not
speaking to the major, but he overheard her.</p>

<p>"Forewarned is forearmed," he said to himself.
"Miss Framley is a pill which must be sugar-coated
to be taken, or, as I may say, well gilded. If the girl
expects to make a good match on the score of her
own personal attractions, she makes an egregious mistake.
No, young lady, I must have your money paid
over, or secured to me on the wedding-day, or your
name can never be Mrs. Ashton."</p>

<p>Of course, while there seemed a chance of securing
Grace Dearborn, the major never gave a thought to
Miss Framley, but Grace's manner at the ball convinced
him that to cherish further hopes in that quarter
would be a mere waste of time. He could never
hope to marry her, except against her will, and was
compelled to leave her out of the account. For
Grace, it must be owned, he cherished as warm an
affection as he was capable of feeling for any one, and
he would have married her even with the proviso that
all her wealth should be settled on herself. He was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
at all events, a man of taste, and he understood very
well the difference between Grace and Miss Framley.</p>

<p>His affairs now had reached a point when it seemed
necessary to take some step to relieve himself from the
claims of creditors, who were daily becoming more
clamorous. In his perplexity, one door of relief
seemed to open to him. His brow cleared, he
brought down his hand upon the table, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Now I see my way clear. It won't be so great a
sacrifice after all. If I can't be Grace's husband, I
will be her uncle."</p>

<small>WOOING THE WIDOW.</small></h2></div>


<p>Mrs. Sheldon was sitting in her morning-room when
a servant appeared and announced that Major Ashton
was in the parlor.</p>

<p>"Major Ashton!" repeated the widow. "Did you
tell him Miss Grace was out?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm; but he said it was of no consequence; he
wanted to see you."</p>

<p>"I suppose he wants to inquire about his chances
with Grace," thought Mrs. Sheldon. "I am sorry I
can't give him any encouragement. I never knew
Grace more prejudiced against a man than she is
against the major. Tell him I will come down at
once." This last to the servant.</p>

<p>Major Ashton, as already foreshadowed, had changed
his plan of campaign&mdash;or, rather, he had changed the
object of his campaign. Knowing that he could not
secure the niece, he had come to lay siege to the aunt.
He felt fortunate in having hit a time when Miss Dearborn
was out.</p>

<p>It was rather a delicate matter to make such a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
change, and required a good deal of tact; but
Major Ashton had considerable confidence in his ability
to make the transfer without exciting suspicion. He
looked about the room in which he was seated, and
surveyed with satisfaction the signs everywhere of opulence
in the owner.</p>

<p>"What matter if the widow is fifteen years my
senior?" he said to himself. "I am not going to
marry her out of sentiment, but for solid pecuniary
reasons. The older she is, the more chance there is
of her leaving me my freedom with her fortune before
I am an old man."</p>

<p>His reflections were interrupted by the entrance of
Mrs. Sheldon, who advanced to meet him with a gracious
smile.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you, major," she said.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Sheldon," he replied, in a tone
and with an <i>empressement</i> new to him and to her.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! he is in trouble," she thought, not
suspecting his change of front. "He wants my assistance."</p>

<p>"Grace is not at home," she said, supposing this
information would interest him.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" he returned, with languid indifference.
"Out shopping, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Really, major, you don't show much interest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the subject. But then that's the way with you men.
You are all of you fickle and faithless."</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Sheldon; you do me injustice&mdash;I am the
soul of fidelity. But you know as well as I do that
Miss Dearborn will have nothing to say to me."</p>

<p>"'Faint heart ne'er won fair lady,' major."</p>

<p>"I will answer in the old couplet:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"'If she be not fair to me,<br />
What care I how fair she be?'"</p>

<p>"Does that mean that you have quite abandoned
the field?" asked Mrs. Sheldon, in some surprise.</p>

<p>"So far as Miss Dearborn is concerned&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"And you don't consider yourself fickle?"</p>

<p>"No. The fact is, my dear Mrs. Sheldon, I can't
go on loving one who doesn't care a rap for me. I
could have loved your niece to the end of my life if
she had reciprocated my affection; but as she does
not, I shall quietly resign her."</p>

<p>"You are sure you won't break your heart, major?"
said the widow, laughing.</p>

<p>"Do I look like it?"</p>

<p>"Well, no; I can't say you do."</p>

<p>"I have not even sworn never to marry," continued
Major Ashton.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have already made a second choice?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>"And you have come to tell me of it? How delightful!"</p>

<p>"I wish I could be sure you would say that after
hearing the name of that choice."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may. Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Now for it!" thought the major. "Now to test
the value of soft sawder!"</p>

<p>He drew his chair nearer that of Mrs. Sheldon, and
began to speak.</p>

<p>"In paying my attention to Miss Dearborn," he
said, "I had an opportunity of becoming acquainted
with the attractive qualities of another. I was not
conscious of the interest which that other excited in
me till my heart, thrown back upon itself in its loneliness,
sought another object for its affection. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I do," murmured Mrs. Sheldon.
"Please be more explicit."</p>

<p>"I will. Mrs. Sheldon, I am a man of few words,
and you may think me abrupt. Will you deign to
accept that which your niece has rejected? Will you
be my wife?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheldon had not dreamed of marrying again,
but she was a woman, and accessible to flattery. She
admired the major; she knew that he was considered
a catch, and though she did not love him, she reflected
with exultation that it would be a great triumph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
for her to carry off the prize for which so many had
sought.</p>

<p>"You surprise me very much, Major Ashton," she
said. "I did not dream of this."</p>

<p>"But it is not disagreeable to you, let me hope?"</p>

<p>"I am of course flattered by your preference, but I
am as old as the hills. Are you aware, Major Ashton,
that I shall soon be forty-one?"</p>

<p>"She's fifty-one if she's a day!" thought the enamored
lover; and he was right.</p>

<p>"You are at the meridian of your beauty, dear Mrs.
Sheldon," he said, taking her unresisting hand.</p>

<p>"I am older than you."</p>

<p>"Not much. I am thirty-eight."</p>

<p>He was really thirty-five.</p>

<p>"There are but three years between us," he resumed.
"Shall three years separate us?"</p>

<p>"You do not look thirty-eight."</p>

<p>"Nor you forty-one," returned Major Ashton.</p>

<p>"Heaven forgive me for the lie!" he said, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>"What would Grace&mdash;what would the world say?"
asked the widow, coyly.</p>

<p>"Why need we care what either will say? Possibly
Miss Dearborn may regret her decision, but it will be
too late. I would not resign you now for her."</p>

<p>"Are you sincere in this, major?" asked Mrs. Sheldon,
with gratified vanity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>"Shall I swear it, my dear one?"</p>

<p>"No; I will believe you, though it seems strange
to me that you should prefer me to one so young
and fair."</p>

<p>"At my age, dear Mrs. Sheldon, a man wants a
home presided over by a fond and faithful wife, who
will not have her head turned by the frivolities of
fashion, but will live for her husband. I do not think
I am mistaken in thinking that you will make me
such a wife."</p>

<p>"I hope I may, dear major."</p>

<p>"Then you grant my suit?"</p>

<p>"Can you not give me a week?" asked the widow,
thinking it best not to grasp at the offer too eagerly.</p>

<p>"I could, but I would rather not. Can you not
end my suspense to-day? We have no one to consult.
We can decide for ourselves. Why need we
delay?"</p>

<p>"Well, major, if you insist upon it, I must say
yes," said the widow, "though I fear we are both
acting foolishly."</p>

<p>"I am not, at any rate," said the major; and he
was doubtless right, for the object of his devotion was
worth at least a quarter of a million, while he was
harassed by creditors whom he could not satisfy.</p>

<p>Of what followed it is needless to speak. Half an
hour later Major Ashton left the house, successful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
complacent. Henceforth he would find his path clear.
He had only to whisper the secret of his engagement
to appease even his most troublesome creditors. The
husband of the wealthy Mrs. Sheldon would be quite
a different person from the impecunious Major Ashton.</p>

<p>When Grace Dearborn returned, she found a new
look on her aunt's face&mdash;a look of mingled complacence
and confusion&mdash;for which she could not account.</p>

<p>"Has anything happened, Aunt Caroline?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Not that I am aware of. Major Ashton has been
here."</p>

<p>"Then I am glad I was absent," said Grace, hastily.</p>

<p>"He would not have troubled you," said Mrs. Sheldon.
"He is not very likely to renew his suit."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that," said Grace, somewhat
surprised, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Indeed he is engaged to be married to&mdash;another."</p>

<p>"That's news, indeed. Who is it, Aunt Caroline?"
asked Grace, with genuine curiosity.</p>

<p>"I hardly know how to tell you," said the widow,
in a tone which gave Grace an inkling of the truth,
amazing as it was.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is going to marry you," she said.</p>

<p>"You have guessed it, Grace," said the widow, in
graceful confusion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>There was a dead silence.</p>

<p>"Don't you congratulate me?" she asked, somewhat
irritably.</p>

<p>"My dear aunt, I hope you will be happy; but it
seems so&mdash;strange," Grace replied.</p>

<p>"I don't know why it should be so strange."</p>

<p>"At any rate, Aunt Caroline, I hope it may be for
your happiness;" and Grace, kissing her aunt hurriedly,
left the room.</p>

<p>"Grace is jealous," thought Mrs. Sheldon, smiling
a little to herself. "She begins to value him now that
she has lost him."</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that she was entirely
mistaken. It was evident to Grace why the major had
sought her aunt in marriage, and she felt that his motives
were wholly mercenary.</p>

<small>PAUL SELLS THE MINE.</small></h2></div>


<p>After a fatiguing trip Paul and his eccentric acquaintance
reached Custer City. It was a rough
journey, but Paul enjoyed it, and he was equally
entertained and instructed by the comments of his
traveling companion, who on his part formed a
special liking for Paul.</p>

<p>"Did you say you owned a hotel in Custer City,
Mr. Scott?" asked Paul, when they were near the end
of the journey.</p>

<p>"Jim Scott owns such a hotel," answered Mr. Scott,
significantly.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, I mean Jim. If the price isn't high,
I will stop there."</p>

<p>"The price is high and the accommodations very
or'nary," said Scott, frankly, "but the price to you
won't be anything. You'll be there as my company."</p>

<p>"Oh, but Jim, you won't make any money if you
act so generously; but I thank you all the same."</p>

<p>"I don't want to make any money out of you,
youngster."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>"I haven't done anything to deserve such kindness,
Jim."</p>

<p>"Then we'll say you haven't. Look here, youngster,
old Jim's been prospered, and he's got no one to
spend his money on. It won't hurt him to give you
free board, and he's goin' to do it."</p>

<p>Paul grasped the rough hand of his new friend, and
frankly accepted the offer, which acceptance Jim appeared
to regard as a personal favor.</p>

<p>He was installed in a tolerably comfortable room in
the Black Hills Hotel&mdash;as comfortable, at any rate, as
the hotel, which was a rough-looking structure, afforded,
and soon made himself at home.</p>

<p>Of course, curiosity soon induced him to roam
about the town. It was composed of extemporaneous
structures, for the town was as yet in its infancy, and
built somewhat on the plan of Cheyenne, and other
towns which he had seen along the Union Pacific
road. The town lots had been staked out sixty by
one hundred and fifty feet in size, and the principal
street, which had been named after General Crook,
was two hundred feet wide. Other streets were a
hundred and fifty feet wide. The "city" was certainly
of mushroom growth, not less than four hundred
buildings having been erected in a single month.</p>

<p>To Paul everything seemed new, strange, and delightful.
It was a state of society to which he had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
been accustomed, and excited his curiosity and interest.
He found that fashionable attire was not at
all required in Custer City. Men went about dressed
like day laborers of the humblest sort, who at home
had been accustomed to the comforts and refinements
of life. Everything was free and unconventional, and
so everybody felt thoroughly independent.</p>

<p>Some of the leading citizens lived in Jim Scott's
hotel, which was pretty well filled.</p>

<p>Occupying a room just opposite Paul's was a small,
elderly man, with stiff, gray hair, a wizened face, and
crafty eyes.</p>

<p>"Who is my opposite neighbor, Jim?" asked Paul,
with some curiosity.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's old Fox&mdash;Simeon Fox."</p>

<p>Paul pricked up his ears. He remembered that
Mr. Bradford's partner in the Blackstone mine bore
the name of Fox. If this was the man, he didn't
doubt from his looks that he was capable of outwitting
and swindling his employer. He didn't think it
politic, however, just at present to show any particular
interest in the man.</p>

<p>"What is his business?" inquired Paul, in an indifferent
tone.</p>

<p>"He is part owner of one of our best mines."</p>

<p>"What is the name of the mine?"</p>

<p>"The Blackstone mine."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>"You say he is part owner; who is the partner?"</p>

<p>"Some rich man in Chicago. Ten to one old
Simeon will fleece him."</p>

<p>"I suppose such a mine as that is worth considerable
money."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"About how much?"</p>

<p>"Why, youngster, you don't want to buy into it,
do you?"</p>

<p>"Not in the present state of my finances," answered
Paul, laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I'd give thirty thousand dollars myself
for the Blackstone mine."</p>

<p>Thirty thousand dollars! That would make fifteen
thousand dollars for a half interest, and Simeon Fox
had tried to induce Mr. Bradford to sell his half for
two thousand dollars! This was an obvious swindle.</p>

<p>"Would Mr. Fox sell out for that sum, do you
think?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"It's likely he wouldn't. He's making too much
money out of it. But, youngster, you seem particularly
interested in the mine."</p>

<p>"I am," answered Paul, quietly.</p>

<p>He had rapidly decided that it would be for his
interest to reveal to Jim Scott his real business at
Custer City.</p>

<p>"Well, that's strange! What can it be to you?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>"Jim, can you keep a secret?"</p>

<p>"Can I? I reckon!"</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you one. I am sent out here by
Mr. Bradford, of Chicago, Simeon Fox's partner."</p>

<p>Scott whistled, and looked at Paul in evident amazement.</p>

<p>"He must have great confidence in you, youngster,
to send out a boy of your age."</p>

<p>"I think he has," answered Paul, with pardonable
pride. "Now, I want to know if you will help me?"</p>

<p>In answer Mr. Scott put his hard and horny hand
into the boy's, and said:</p>

<p>"You can depend on Jim Scott every time."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you how the case stands. This Fox
is continually sending on discouraging accounts about
the mine to Mr. Bradford, and he lately offered him
two thousand dollars for his half."</p>

<p>"The mean cuss! I beg your pardon, that ain't
the word I meant to use, but maybe its the best."</p>

<p>"He thought Mr. Bradford would get discouraged,
and sell out without taking any trouble to verify his
statement."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"But he suspected there was a conspiracy to cheat
him, and he sent me out with full power to act for
him."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>"That's a good 'un! And old Fox doesn't know of
your bein' here."</p>

<p>"He has no idea that Mr. Bradford has sent a messenger."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to see the old rascal taken in."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradford gave five thousand dollars for his
half of the mine."</p>

<p>"And it was a good bargain at that price. But he
never ought to have taken Simeon Fox as a partner."</p>

<p>"What would you advise me to do, Jim?"</p>

<p>"You might take old Fox at his word, and buy his
half for two thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Then the swindle would be on our side."</p>

<p>"No, because he proposed the trade."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradford is a rich man, and though he wants
justice in the matter, he does not care to take any advantage."</p>

<p>"Then, Paul, I'll tell you what you'd better do."</p>

<p>"What, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Have you full authority to act for Mr. Bradford?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as I can show you."</p>

<p>"I'll take your word for it. Sell to me."</p>

<p>"Are you willing to buy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you'll give me a good bargain?"</p>

<p>"What would you consider a good bargain, Jim?"</p>

<p>"I'll pay you twelve thousand dollars for the share
you have to sell, money down, or my draft on Chicago."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>"Will it be worth that to you?"</p>

<p>"It will be worth more or I wouldn't buy, but it
isn't worth that to your principal, for he can't be here
to look after old Fox with his tricks."</p>

<p>"He may try some of them on you, Jim."</p>

<p>"I'll risk it. He'll find I get up in the morning as
early as he does. To be plain with you, Paul, I'll
make him an offer, give or take, and either way I
shall make money. If the whole mine is in my
hands I can make it pay."</p>

<p>"Very well, Jim. I am ready to accept your offer."</p>

<p>"I didn't much think," said Scott, laughing, "when
I came across you in Cheyenne, that I should buy a
mine of you."</p>

<p>"You didn't think I carried one about with me?"
said Paul, laughing.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't let Simeon know about our bargain just
yet. I want you to have a talk with him, and see
what the old rascal has to say."</p>

<small>DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND.</small></h2></div>


<p>In accordance with Jim Scott's wish, and also because
he desired to have a better idea of Simeon Fox,
Paul took a walk one morning out to the Blackstone
mine.</p>

<p>All seemed activity, and, under the personal direction
of Mr. Fox, the work was proceeding well.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p253.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">Paul approached the old man, and said, politely: "I believe I am
speaking to Mr. Fox."</p>

<p>After a few minutes spent in looking about him,
Paul approached the old man, and said, politely:</p>

<p>"I believe I am speaking to Mr. Fox?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's my name," said the other, fixing his
small, round eyes searchingly on our young hero.</p>

<p>"You are manager of the Blackstone mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I have no work to give out," answered
the old man, brusquely&mdash;"got all I want."</p>

<p>Paul smiled.</p>

<p>"I think you make a mistake," he replied. "I am
not looking for work."</p>

<p>"Then if you have no business with me, I can't
stand here wasting my time."</p>

<p>"I have business with you, Mr. Fox. In fact, I
have come to Custer City on purpose to see you."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>"I can't waste my time with boys," said Simeon
Fox, rudely.</p>

<p>"I come from Chicago," said Paul, composedly.</p>

<p>The old man looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Paul Palmer."</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen."</p>

<p>"Then you'd better wait till you grow a little older
before you take up the time of a business man."</p>

<p>"I come from Mr. Bradford," continued Paul.</p>

<p>"Eh?" ejaculated Simeon Fox, astonished.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradford, who owns one-half of the Blackstone
mine, has sent me out here to look after his
interests."</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Bradford must be a fool to employ
a whipper-snapper like you."</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen. At any rate, I have
come out here with full powers to act for him in any
way I see fit."</p>

<p>"Do you expect me to believe all that, youngster?"
demanded Fox, surveying our hero disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Please read that," said Paul, drawing out a paper
which conferred upon him the power he claimed.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Simeon Fox, "it strikes me
there must be a great scarcity of business men in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Chicago, when my partner is obliged to send out
a half-grown boy like you."</p>

<p>"That doesn't alter the fact that I represent Mr.
Bradford, does it?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the old man, slowly.</p>

<p>He was thinking to himself:</p>

<p>"It will be easy to hoodwink this boy. He is inexperienced,
and will swallow all I say."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, aloud, with a change of manner,
"that's my partner's affair, not mine. Now, young
man, what have you to say to me?"</p>

<p>"How is the mine doing, Mr. Fox?"</p>

<p>Simeon Fox screwed up his face into a doleful
expression, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Badly," he answered.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it come up to your expectations?"</p>

<p>"No. You can tell Mr. Bradford that we were
badly taken in when we bought it."</p>

<p>"You paid ten thousand dollars, Mr. Bradford tells
me."</p>

<p>"Yes; and half the money is thrown away."</p>

<p>"You don't consider it worth what was paid, then?"</p>

<p>Simeon Fox shook his head.</p>

<p>"We shall never get our money back."</p>

<p>"Will you give five thousand dollars for Mr. Bradford's
share in the mine?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>"Young man, do you take me for a fool?" demanded
Fox, with seeming indignation.</p>

<p>"Quite the contrary, Mr. Fox," answered Paul,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Then why do you ask me such ridiculous questions?"</p>

<p>"I was merely trying to get your idea of the value
of the mine."</p>

<p>"Well, now you know it."</p>

<p>"You think it is not worth ten thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"No!" answered Mr. Fox, with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Then," continued Paul, "you will have no hesitation
in accepting the offer I am about to make you."</p>

<p>"An offer?&mdash;you make me?" said the old man, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I offer you, in Mr. Bradford's name,
five thousand dollars for your half of the mine."</p>

<p>"You offer me&mdash;five thousand dollars!" ejaculated
Fox, staring at Paul in surprise and consternation.</p>

<p>"Exactly so."</p>

<p>"When I tell you it is too much?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am offering you a good bargain."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to throw away Mr. Bradford's
money?" gasped Fox.</p>

<p>"No; but if Mr. Bradford finds fault with me, I
will stand the blame."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>"I don't understand this," said Mr. Fox, nervously.
"You are joking with me."</p>

<p>"I may joke sometimes, Mr. Fox, but I would not
be so disrespectful as to joke with you in a matter of
this kind."</p>

<p>"Why do you offer me five thousand dollars when
I say the property&mdash;the whole property&mdash;is not worth
that?" demanded Fox, irritably.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, Mr. Fox. You admit
that I offer you a good price, and yet you make objection
to accepting it."</p>

<p>"What would Mr. Bradford do with the mine if he
bought it? He isn't coming out here," said Fox,
eying Paul searchingly.</p>

<p>"I should select a man to superintend it."</p>

<p>"You!" repeated Fox, contemptuously. "What
do you know about mines?"</p>

<p>"I should try to learn something," answered Paul,
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"I never in all my life heard of such a ridiculous
thing as intrusting such important business to a beardless
boy. Why, you haven't even a mustache."</p>

<p>"I hope to have one in due time," said Paul,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't waste any more time with you," said
Fox, crustily, and he turned away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>"Stay a moment, Mr. Fox," said Paul. "I have
made you a serious offer. Do you accept it or not?"</p>

<p>"No!" shouted Fox, angrily.</p>

<p>"Then all I can say is, you have refused a good
offer."</p>

<p>"A good offer!" shouted Fox. "Why, the mine is
worth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he stopped short in confusion, for he was
about to commit himself badly.</p>

<p>Paul finished out his sentence for him.</p>

<p>"The mine is worth a good deal more than I have
offered. That is quite true, Mr. Fox."</p>

<p>"I didn't say anything of the kind," snarled Fox.</p>

<p>"No, but you were going to. And now, Mr. Fox,
as I see I can't do any business with you, I may
as well tell you that I have sold out Mr. Bradford's
share of the mine for a satisfactory price, and shall not
have any further occasion to take up your time with
business."</p>

<p>"You have sold Mr. Bradford's share?" ejaculated
Fox, in dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"To Jim Scott."</p>

<p>"Jim Scott! I won't agree to it," returned Fox, in
intense disgust, for he knew that he could not cheat
his new partner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>"Your permission was not needed," said Paul.
"Either of you had a perfect right to dispose of his
share of the property to any one he pleased."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you offer it to me?" asked Fox, looking
deeply disappointed.</p>

<p>"To be plain with you, Mr. Fox, because it has
been your policy to depreciate the property. You
wouldn't have paid five thousand dollars, while Scott
has paid me more than twice as much."</p>

<p>"I must see him," muttered Simeon Fox; and he
went back to the hotel, looking as if he had just been
invited to his own funeral.</p>

<p>Two days afterward Jim Scott drew Paul aside.</p>

<p>"Paul," he said, "I have just sold my share of the
mine to Simeon Fox."</p>

<p>"I hope you didn't lose anything by the trade."</p>

<p>"I guess not," chuckled Jim. "I made the old
sinner pay sixteen thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!"</p>

<p>"He fought hard, but he had to pay it. And now
do you know what I am going to do?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I have made four thousand dollars by the trade.
I am going to give you half of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Scott&mdash;Jim, I mean!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Paul. You helped me make the money,
and half of it is fairly yours."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>Two thousand dollars! Paul was not sure whether
he was awake or dreaming, but there flashed upon
him all the advantage he would derive from so large a
sum of money, and that he could emancipate his
mother at once from the slavery of the needle, and he
clasped Jim's hand in fervent gratitude.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />

<small>A SCENE AT OMAHA.</small></h2></div>


<p>Paul had good reason to exult in the success of his
mission. He had certainly done well for his employer,
for he had sold out his mining property at a profit
of seven thousand dollars, while as for himself he had
two thousand dollars to show as the recompense of his
shrewdness.</p>

<p>Our hero did not immediately leave Custer City, but
looked about him, as instructed by Mr. Bradford. The
result was that he purchased a new mine, paying three
thousand dollars, one thousand being on his own account,
the other two-thirds on behalf of his employer.
This he left in charge of his new friend, Jim Scott,
and, when matters had been fully arranged, started on
his way home.</p>

<p>At Omaha Paul decided to stop over for twenty-four
hours, having a little business to attend to for Mr.
Bradford.</p>

<p>He applied at a hotel for accommodations.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said the landlord, "that I can't give
you a room by yourself. I am crowded."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>Paul hesitated, for he didn't like sharing the room
of a total stranger.</p>

<p>"Are the other hotels in the city likely to be full?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"More than likely. Still, you can try."</p>

<p>However, Paul didn't care to take the time for
searching, when there was such a slight chance of
success.</p>

<p>"Where can you put me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In No. 37. There is one gentleman there, who
seems quiet; I don't think he will disturb you."</p>

<p>"Are there two beds?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose I may as well make it do."</p>

<p>Paul was accordingly shown up to No. 37. He
found that it was what is called a double room. That
is, there were two beds in it.</p>

<p>"Where is the other gentleman?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He won't be in till late in the evening," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to remember his name?" Paul inquired.</p>

<p>"John Davenport."</p>

<p>"Where does he hail from?"</p>

<p>"Kansas City."</p>

<p>"Probably he is all right," thought our hero,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
"though I don't quite like the idea of rooming with
a complete stranger. Well, I will take the room."</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the afternoon. Paul deposited
his carpet-bag in the room, but what articles
of value he had he left for safe keeping in the office of
the hotel, as prudent travelers generally do, at any rate
when they find themselves paired off with strangers.</p>

<p>Deferring his business to the next day, Paul took a
walk about the streets and made himself familiar with
the outward appearance of a city which has become
one of the most important on the transcontinental
route. He admired the new high-school building,
built on the site of the old capitol, with its spire rising
nearly two hundred feet above the street, the elegant
private dwellings on the hill, and perhaps more
than all, the huge railroad bridge that spans the Missouri
River. Everywhere he marked signs of prosperity
and enterprise, and he felt that it must be inspiring
to live where growth is so rapid.</p>

<p>He used his time well, and went back to the hotel
to supper.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock, feeling fatigued with his journey,
he decided to go up stairs to bed, so as to feel
quite refreshed the next day.</p>

<p>The room was empty, his roommate, Mr. Davenport,
of Kansas City, not having arrived.</p>

<p>Paul undressed and got into bed. How long he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
slept he did not know, but he woke all at once, and
from his bed looked on a sight which instantly awakened
him thoroughly.</p>

<p>A man was exploring his carpet-bag, which for convenience
he had deposited on the table, in search, no
doubt, of valuables.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there?" demanded Paul, sitting
up in bed.</p>

<p>The man turned suddenly, and revealed to Paul the
well known features of Luke Denton.</p>

<small>A THIEF FOILED.</small></h2></div>


<p>Until that moment Denton had not taken the
trouble to notice the face of his roommate. He had
only observed that he was a boy.</p>

<p>The recognition was mutual, and it is hard to tell
who was the more surprised.</p>

<p>"The train boy, as I'm a sinner!" ejaculated Denton,
in amazement.</p>

<p>"Luke Denton!" ejaculated Paul in turn.</p>

<p>"How came you here?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"What are you doing with my carpet-bag?" demanded
Paul.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother!" returned Denton, defiantly. "That's
my business!"</p>

<p>"I should say that it was my business," retorted
Paul.</p>

<p>"Where do you keep your money? I don't find
any in the bag."</p>

<p>"I don't keep any there."</p>

<p>"Give me your pocket-book quick, youngster. I
am hard up, and I must have money."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>As he spoke he advanced toward the bed.</p>

<p>"You can't have mine, Mr. Denton," said Paul.
"When did you get out of jail?"</p>

<p>"Boy, do you want me to kill you?" demanded
Denton, fiercely.</p>

<p>"No, and I sha'n't permit you to rob me either."</p>

<p>"Listen to me!" said Denton, rapidly. "I am a
desperate man, as I have already told you. I have
escaped from prison, but I have used up what money
I had. I must have more. I don't forget that you
were the means of sending me to prison, but if you
will give me all the money you have about you, I will
let you go this time."</p>

<p>"Suppose I refuse?" said Paul.</p>

<p>"Then I will strangle you first, and rob you afterward,"
answered Luke Denton, wickedly.</p>

<p>As he spoke he moved nearer the bed, but he
paused suddenly when Paul drew a revolver from beneath
his pillow, and pointed it at him.</p>

<p>"Stop there, Mr. Luke Denton," he said, firmly.
"I should be very unwilling to shoot you, but I mean
to defend myself. One step nearer and I fire!"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't dare do it," said Denton, chafing
with disappointment.</p>

<p>"You'd better not take the risk."</p>

<p>"I was only joking," said Denton. "I thought I
would see if I could scare you. I'm going to bed."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>"Not in this room."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You don't go to bed in this room," repeated Paul.
"This room is mine. I have a better claim to it
than you, for I engaged it first."</p>

<p>"I do not feel safe in passing the night in your
company."</p>

<p>"That is nothing to me."</p>

<p>"Listen, Luke Denton. Unless you leave this
room at once I will ring the bell, summon the landlord,
and denounce you as an escaped convict."</p>

<p>Luke Denton was so angry that, had he been
armed, he might have fired at our hero, but his
stock of money had been too limited to allow him
to purchase a pistol.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he said. "I will do you no harm."</p>

<p>"Are you going?" asked Paul, still keeping him
covered with his weapon.</p>

<p>There was no help for it. With a muttered execration
Luke Denton left the room, and Paul, glad to be
rid of him, locked the door, and breathed a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>It may be well to add here that Denton was not recaptured,
but months afterward was shot in California
by a miner whom he had robbed. It was a sad ending
to a life which might have been honorably spent, for
he was a man of excellent abilities and capacity, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
preferred the hazardous career of a thief to the more
prosaic paths of industry and honesty.</p>

<p>Next day Paul purchased a ticket for Chicago.</p>

<p>As he stood at the depot waiting for his train his
attention was drawn to the pale and sorrowful face of
a woman who had just inquired the price of a ticket to
Chicago, and, as if it were beyond her means, turned
away with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"Are you in trouble, madam?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. "It is important for me to
go to Chicago, but I have not money enough within
five dollars."</p>

<p>"I will advance the money," said Paul, stirred with
pity.</p>

<p>"God bless you, young man!" exclaimed the lady,
fervently. "You don't know how important it is for
me to make this journey."</p>

<small>THE LADY'S SECRET.</small></h2></div>


<p>With great politeness Paul selected a seat for the
lady, took charge of her traveling-bag, and then,
without betraying the least curiosity, took a seat in
front of her.</p>

<p>"You are taking a great deal of trouble for me,"
she said, gratefully.</p>

<p>"No trouble at all," said Paul, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"That shows you have a kind heart. Have you a
mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam;" and Paul's face brightened as he
thought how soon he should see her. He had not got
weaned from his home and his mother, though he had
reached the age at which many boys consider themselves
entitled to do it.</p>

<p>"God grant she may long be spared to you!" said
the lady.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have a son?" said Paul, kindly.</p>

<p>"No; but if I had, I could wish he were such as
you."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>"Dutiful and affectionate to his mother, as I am
sure you are, and kind and obliging even to strangers,
as you have been to me."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have been unfortunate, madam,"
said Paul, respectfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have met with sorrow. I will make you
my confidant, since your kindness entitles you to my
confidence."</p>

<p>"Do not think it necessary to speak of your troubles
if it will give you pain," said our hero.</p>

<p>"It will bring me relief to speak to some one who
will sympathize with me."</p>

<p>Paul could not interpose further objection. Moreover,
he was not without curiosity, and was desirous
of learning in what way his new friend had suffered.</p>

<p>"Eight years since," she commenced, "in the city
of San Francisco, I met a gentleman who seemed
struck with my appearance. At all events, he paid me
marked attention, and it was not long before he asked
my hand in marriage. I must premise that my father
was considered rich, and I myself had a fortune of
fifty thousand dollars at my own disposal. It had been
bequeathed me by a sister of my mother. I forgot too
late that it was the knowledge of this fact that had
attracted my suitor, and that he was quite indifferent
to me. However, I suspected nothing at the time.
My lover, for he persuaded me that he was such, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
not lacking in devotion. Moreover, he had agreeable
manners, and was well calculated by his smooth plausibility
to deceive any one, certainly an inexperienced
girl like myself.</p>

<p>"Well, to cut matters short, his suit was accepted.
Not only did I favor him, but my father and mother
were both well pleased with the match. We made a
brief journey as far as Los Angeles, and on our return
purchased a pleasant house on California street.</p>

<p>"Though my money was at my own disposal, I
could not long resist the entreaties of my husband to
give him the management of it. He professed to
know how to invest it so as to double it in a year's
time. On the strength of expected gains he lived in
more expensive style than I thought prudent, and
wasted more than I can guess at the gaming-table.
At any rate, in less than two years the property was
gone, and my father was obliged to come to our help.</p>

<p>"Now that I had nothing left, my husband began
to treat me with cruel neglect. I feared even that he
would raise his hand against me, and such was my
misery that I hardly knew whether I was relieved or
otherwise when one morning I found my husband
missing, and a letter of farewell on my bureau, stating
that I should never again see him."</p>

<p>"Have you never seen him since?" asked Paul, with
interest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>"Never; but I have known for some time that he
was in Chicago."</p>

<p>"And you wish to rejoin him?"</p>

<p>"No, but to foil him in his wicked plans. I
learned, four days since, that he was about to marry
an estimable lady in Chicago, wholly forgetful of the
wife he had deserted. I felt that there was no time to
lose. As I knew my father would not consent to my
journeying alone on such an errand, I departed from
San Francisco secretly, and, as it proved, with insufficient
money. You came to my assistance, and I shall
take care that you do not lose by it."</p>

<p>"I have no anxiety on that point," said Paul.</p>

<p>"But I do not wish you to suffer for your kindness.
You can do me still another favor."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"When we reach Chicago I do not wish to go to a
hotel. If your mother will allow me to stay with
her temporarily, I shall feel much indebted to her and
to you."</p>

<p>"My mother lives in a very plain&mdash;indeed, in an
humble style."</p>

<p>"As if I cared for that. I know she is good, since
she has a good son."</p>

<p>Paul saw no objection, and, on reaching Chicago,
took the lady at once to his mother's lodgings.</p>

<small>MAJOR ASHTON'S ENGAGEMENT.</small></h2></div>


<p>The announcement that her aunt had agreed to
marry Major Ashton was intensely disagreeable to
Grace Dearborn. She knew, if her aunt did not, that
he was simply a mercenary adventurer, who, failing to
secure her hand and fortune, was now scheming for
her aunt's larger fortune, and willing to take her hand
with it, in spite of the disparity in their years.</p>

<p>"My dear aunt," she said, "I hope you will consider
well the step you propose to take."</p>

<p>"Why should I need to consider?" asked Mrs.
Sheldon, somewhat displeased. "I have known the
major for a considerable time, and I know the estimation
in which he is held in Chicago."</p>

<p>"I do not think he is an honorable, reliable man."</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand very well why you are prejudiced
against him, Grace," said her aunt, sharply.</p>

<p>"And why, Aunt Caroline?"</p>

<p>"Because he was a suitor of yours, and you are
mortified to think he should accept your rejection as
final, and so soon pay his attentions in another
quarter."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>"My dear aunt," said Grace, earnestly, "you were
never more mistaken. I feel no interest in him or his
marriage, save as it affects you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheldon was inwardly sensible that she was
acting foolishly, and this made her only the more
indisposed to listen to her niece's remonstrances.</p>

<p>"What objections can you possibly think of, Grace?
Perhaps you do not think well of second marriages."</p>

<p>"It is not that, Aunt Caroline. I think second
marriages are often wise."</p>

<p>"And why not in this case?" demanded Mrs. Sheldon,
coldly.</p>

<p>"You are aware, Aunt Caroline, that you are considerably
older than Major Ashton."</p>

<p>"Not so very much older. Major Ashton tells me
he is thirty-eight."</p>

<p>"He does not look that. But even then you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are a <i>little</i> older," admitted the widow, wondering
whether Grace knew her real age. At any rate, she
knew it would be of no use to call herself forty, as her
niece had something like a correct idea of how much
she exceeded that age. "However," she added,
quickly steering away from a topic which was not
acceptable, "that is Major Ashton's affair. I myself
made that objection, and mentioned my age, but he
said, like a true gentleman as he is, that it was unimportant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
in comparison with the similarity of our
tastes."</p>

<p>"I had not supposed that you and Major Ashton
were so similar in your tastes," said Grace, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Because you have never understood or appreciated
the major, Grace," returned her aunt.</p>

<p>"Then you are quite decided upon this marriage,
Aunt Caroline?" said Grace, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Quite so, Grace."</p>

<p>"Then I can only hope, Aunt Caroline, that it will
meet your wishes and expectations."</p>

<p>"I am willing to run the risk, Grace," said her
aunt, complacently.</p>

<p>As Grace left the room Mrs. Sheldon said to
herself:</p>

<p>"I expected Grace would feel disturbed. She may
say what she likes, but it is clear to me that she is jealous
and mortified that the major has so soon recovered
from her rejection of him."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLII.<br />

<small>A REVELATION.</small></h2></div>


<p>Grace felt that her aunt's strange resolution to marry
was likely to affect her seriously. Hitherto she had
formed one of her aunt's household, and bearing a
part of the expenses, had lived under her aunt's protection.
She felt that should her aunt marry Major
Ashton this arrangement must be broken up. She
was not willing to live under the same roof with
Major Ashton, with that gentleman holding toward
her the embarrassing relation of uncle. Nothing
could be further from the truth than her aunt's
hypothesis that Grace was suffering from jealousy and
mortified pride. So far from it, she felt an active
dislike for the major, and regarded him with contempt
as an unscrupulous fortune hunter.</p>

<p>When the question of her own future came up before
her, she was perplexed, and with reason. Save
Mrs. Sheldon, she had no near relatives, and she did
not feel inclined to set up an independent establishment
for herself, and live alone&mdash;that is, until she
should marry. At present there was no prospect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
marriage. Of suitors who had offered themselves
there was no lack, but on none of them did she for a
moment seriously think. So far as they were concerned
she was heart-whole. Had she never met one
to whom she could fancy herself happily united? If
so, she had not admitted it even to herself.</p>

<p>On the day after the conversation with her aunt, she
was sitting idly at her desk, her mind occupied by the
embarrassments of her position, when the servant entered
the room.</p>

<p>"Miss Grace," she said, "there is a lady in the
parlor who wishes to see you."</p>

<p>"A lady? Who is it? Did she give you her card?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Grace."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see her before?"</p>

<p>"She has never been here before. I think, Miss
Grace," added the girl, hesitating, "that it is some
one in trouble."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so, Jane?"</p>

<p>"Because she looks so sad."</p>

<p>"Does she seem like a poor woman?"</p>

<p>"She was dressed very respectably," answered Jane,
who appeared to be in doubt how to answer the
question.</p>

<p>"Tell her I will be down directly," said Grace, who
could not find it in her heart to refuse a person in
trouble, though she suspected there would be an appeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
for money. As she was known to be an heiress,
such applications were of very common occurrence.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Grace entered the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Seated on the sofa was a woman, dressed in sober
tints, and apparently rather past middle life.</p>

<p>She rose as Grace entered, but in the imperfect light
the young lady did not recognize her.</p>

<p>"Miss Dearborn, you do not remember me?" she
said.</p>

<p>"I cannot at this moment recall you," was the
answer.</p>

<p>"I am Mrs. Vernon."</p>

<p>"The artist's mother," said Grace, quickly.</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>"I hope all is well with you&mdash;and him! You look
sad."</p>

<p>"I have reason to be, Miss Dearborn. My poor
son is very sick. I do not know if he will live."</p>

<p>Grace could not account for the effect of these
words, or for the thrill of emotion which agitated her,
for she had not read the secret of her own heart.</p>

<p>"How long has this been?" she asked, hurriedly.</p>

<p>"For a week only. Frederic seems to be suffering
from a slow fever, and the physician tells me that the
chief difficulty in the way of recovery is the mental
depression which weighs him down."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>"Has he not been prospering? Is he in pecuniary
trouble?"</p>

<p>"No; he has been unusually prosperous, and has
on hand more orders than he could attend to if he
were in health."</p>

<p>"Have you any knowledge of any other cause for
his depression?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Dearborn; I know it only too well. It
is for this I came here to see you."</p>

<p>"Name it. If there is anything I can do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't promise too hastily. You may be offended
if I tell you my poor boy's secret."</p>

<p>"No, no," answered Grace; but her agitation
showed that she began to suspect.</p>

<p>"Plainly then, my dear young lady, he is madly,
hopelessly in love with you."</p>

<p>Grace half-rose from her seat, while her expressive
face showed a variety of contending emotions.</p>

<p>"Do not be angry," implored Mrs. Vernon. "The
poor boy cannot help it. He never would have dared
speak to you, nor would he have allowed me to come
to you had he known my intention."</p>

<p>"May you not be mistaken?" asked Grace, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"No; he has spoken to me more than once about
his love, and in his delirium your name has been constantly
upon his lips."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>Grace was deeply moved.</p>

<p>"I did not dream of this," she said; "it distresses
me."</p>

<p>"I knew you would sympathize with us," said the
poor mother.</p>

<p>"I should like to do more. Tell me&mdash;what can I
do for you both?"</p>

<p>"I was about to tell you. Are you willing to call
on my poor boy, to let him see you once more? A
few kind words would do him much good, and perhaps
turn the scales in his favor."</p>

<p>"I will go&mdash;I will go at once, if you wish me."</p>

<p>"How kind you are! No wonder my poor boy
loves you. Oh, Miss Dearborn, I wish you were poor
like ourselves, so that Frederic might have some hope
of gaining your hand. I know of course it is useless.
He is a poor artist&mdash;you a rich heiress, and a favorite
in society."</p>

<p>Grace did not reply, but speedily made herself ready
and accompanied Mrs. Vernon to her lodgings.</p>

<p>They were modest, but no longer humble. As the
young artist prospered he took care to remove his
mother from the poor home which they had been
forced to occupy, and were at present in neat apartments,
in a respectable part of the city.</p>

<p>"I will go in and prepare him," said the mother.</p>






<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>Grace remained waiting in the outer room till, summoned
by Mrs. Vernon, she entered the sick-chamber.</p>

<p>The artist was reclining on the bed, his face thinned,
and his eyes unnaturally bright with fever. Over his
wasted face there came a look of glad rapture as he
saw the one he loved enter the room.</p>

<p>"Grace&mdash;Miss Dearborn!" he cried. "This is, indeed,
kind. Mother, you did not tell me who had
come to see me."</p>

<p>"No; I wished to surprise you, my boy."</p>

<p>"It is a glad surprise," he murmured.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p281.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">"I am sorry to see you so ill, Mr. Vernon," said Grace.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry to see you so ill, Mr. Vernon," said
Grace, approaching, with a look of pity on her face.
"Why did I not know before that you were ill?"</p>

<p>"I did not know that you would care&mdash;much," he
said, slowly.</p>

<p>"I do care much; I look upon you as a valued
friend."</p>

<p>His eyes fell as he heard these words. Yes, she
looked upon him as a friend; but with that he felt he
never could be content.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said; "you were always kind."
After a pause, he said:</p>

<p>"Miss Dearborn, I am afraid you would no longer
be kind if you knew all."</p>

<p>"I am sure there is nothing that would change my
good opinion of you."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>"Ah! but there may be. If you knew how presumptuous
I have been! I have a great mind to tell
you, if you will first promise me your forgiveness."</p>

<p>"I promise it!" said Grace, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Then, Miss Dearborn, Grace, forgetting the difference
between us, forgetting that you were a rich and
brilliant heiress, and I a poor and struggling artist, I
confess that I have dared to love you!"</p>

<p>She did not start nor exhibit surprise, for she had
been forewarned. Instead she smiled.</p>

<p>"Surely it is not hard to forgive such an offense as
that," she said.</p>

<p>"Then you are not angry?" he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"No; why should I be when an honorable man&mdash;a
man of talent&mdash;pays me the highest compliment in his
power."</p>

<p>"Thank you. You make me very happy," sighed
Vernon, with relief. "Ah! if things were different, if
you were poor I might hope that you would look upon
me with favor."</p>

<p>"Is my fortune such an impediment then, Frederic?"
asked Grace, smiling.</p>

<p>"Surely," he exclaimed, his face glowing with sudden
hope, "you do not mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean that there is nothing in your proposal to
offend me. I mean that, if you will give me time, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
will question my own heart, and if it responds, my
fortune shall not separate us."</p>

<p>"God bless you!" exclaimed Vernon, and his face
wore a look of happiness to which it had long been a
stranger.</p>

<p>Do any of my readers doubt how it will end?</p>

<p>"Do I know him?" repeated the lady, pressing her
hand to her side. "<i>He is my husband!</i>"</p>

<p>"Your husband!" exclaimed Paul, in surprise and
perplexity. "Then how can he marry another?"</p>

<p>"It is a wicked deception!" said the strange lady.
"This marriage must be stopped. I cannot permit
him to deceive a worthy lady, as Mrs. Sheldon doubtless
is. Is she wealthy?"</p>

<p>"She is very wealthy," said Mrs. Palmer. "I have
heard her fortune estimated at a quarter of a million."</p>

<p>"That explains it," said his unfortunate wife. "He
only thinks of money. He married me for money,
and he would make her a second victim."</p>

<p>"She must beat least fifteen years older than the
major," said Mrs. Palmer.</p>

<p>"He would care little for that, since it is not love
but money that influences him. Where does Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Sheldon live? I must see her at once, and warn
her."</p>

<p>"I know where she lives," said Paul. "I will accompany
you, if you wish."</p>

<p>"Will you, indeed, be so kind?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I shall be glad to do anything for a
family that has been so kind to my mother and myself."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Paul stood on the steps of
Mrs. Sheldon's handsome house, with the lady at his
side.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Sheldon at home?" he asked of the servant,
who answered his call.</p>

<p>"I believe so. What name shall I say?"</p>

<p>"Paul Palmer. Will you say that my business is
urgent?"</p>

<p>"You can come in," said the servant.</p>

<p>So the two entered the parlor, and in a few minutes
Mrs. Sheldon, in some surprise at the message, entered
also.</p>

<p>Paul rose and bowed.</p>

<p>"You are my niece's <i>protege</i>, I believe," said Mrs.
Sheldon, "or rather the boy in whom she is interested."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, Miss Dearborn has been very kind
to me."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>"You have a message for me?" asked the widow,
looking inquiringly at the lady with Paul.</p>

<p>"This lady wishes to speak to you," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed," said Mrs. Sheldon, coldly.</p>

<p>"Madam," cried the stranger, in unmistakable emotion,
"is this true what I hear? Are you engaged to
marry Major Ashton?"</p>

<p>"By what right do you inquire?" demanded Mrs.
Sheldon, haughtily.</p>

<p>"By what right? Oh, madam, by the best of all
rights. <i>I am his wife!</i>"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheldon stared at the stranger in dismay and
incredulity.</p>

<p>"I cannot believe this," she said, sharply. "You
must be beside yourself."</p>

<p>"No, madam; it is only too true. Look! I have
my marriage certificate. You must believe that."
Rapidly she told her story, and, though much
against her will, Mrs. Sheldon was forced to believe
the truth of the story. It was terribly mortifying to
find that she had come so near being duped, and her
heart was stirred with indignation against the smooth-tongued
deceiver, who had so craftily schemed against
her happiness.</p>

<p>Scarcely was the story told when a ring was heard
at the door, and the servant entering announced
"Major Ashton."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>"Bring him in!" said Mrs. Sheldon, sternly. "Now
I shall know the truth."</p>

<p>Major Ashton, dressed in the most careful manner,
with a rose in his button-hole, his heart full of happy
anticipations of the fortune that would soon be his,
was ushered in.</p>

<p>He did not at first notice the other occupants of the
room, but hurried to Mrs. Sheldon, with a very good
affectation of a lover's fervor. He was about to press
a kiss on the widow's cheek, when she stepped back
and said:</p>

<p>"Major Ashton, I wish to introduce you to this
lady."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton, the ill-used wife, rose at the words,
and threw aside her veil.</p>

<p>"Oh, Reginald!" she cried, reproachfully.</p>

<p>One look was enough, and he stood as if paralyzed.</p>

<p>"Confusion!" he muttered. "What evil fate
brought you here?"</p>

<p>"I came to prevent your doing a wicked thing,
Reginald. I came to prevent your deceiving this good
lady as you deceived, or worse than deceived me."</p>

<p>By this time Major Ashton had partially recovered
his self-possession. He meant to fight it out if
possible.</p>

<p>"How did you escape from the asylum?" he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>"From the asylum!" repeated his wife. "What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sheldon," said the major, turning to his affianced
bride, "I am sorry you have been disturbed by
a madwoman. This lady is my sister. For years she
has been confined in a mad-house. She is under the
singular delusion that she is my wife, and she may
have told you so."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheldon looked relieved, but it was only for a
moment. She remembered the certificate.</p>

<p>"I have seen your marriage certificate," she said.</p>

<p>"A forged paper," he replied, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sheldon," said the wife, "I beg of you not
to believe him. He has no sister, and I have heard
him say he never had any. Of my marriage I can call
living witnesses, but it will take time. If, however,
you will telegraph to my father in San Francisco,
you will have speedy proof of the falsehood of his
assertions."</p>

<p>"I believe you," said the widow. "I do not think
you would deceive me."</p>

<p>"Then you choose to be humbugged by a madwoman?"
said Major Ashton. "Have you no more
confidence in me?"</p>

<p>"I will reserve my opinion. Are you willing that I
should telegraph to San Francisco?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>Major Ashton hesitated a moment. He saw that
his last chance was gone.</p>

<p>His wife's story was sure to be confirmed.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, recklessly, "the game is up! It
is unfortunately true that I am tied to this lady. I
hoped before this she would do me the favor to die
and leave me free."</p>

<p>"Go, sir!" said Mrs. Sheldon, indignantly. "I am
fortunate in being saved from marriage with such
a man."</p>

<p>"I sha'n't break my heart," said the major, mockingly.
"I am sorry to lose your fortune, but for yourself,
I am well rid of the engagement. If you had not
been blind, you would have understood that nothing
but your money would have induced me to marry a
woman old enough to be my mother."</p>

<p>This was the unkindest cut of all. Poor Mrs.
Sheldon sank back in an arm-chair in a fit of hysterics,
and the major, with a cynical smile, left the
room.</p>

<p>The widow was a kind-hearted woman, and, when
she came to herself, generously insisted upon Mrs.
Ashton remaining under her roof till she had recovered
from the fatigue of her journey. Later she purchased
her a return ticket to San Francisco, and
secured an escort for her. She expressed a hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
that her recreant husband would return to his duty,
but Mrs. Ashton shook her head.</p>

<p>"I could never trust him," she said. "I am better
off with my father," and Mrs. Sheldon felt that she
was right.</p>

<p>Major Ashton disappeared from Chicago, but where
he went has not transpired. Perhaps amid other
scenes he may be laying snares for other heiresses.
Mrs. Sheldon, at any rate, has been saved from his
arts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLIV.<br />

<small>CONCLUSION.</small></h2></div>


<p>Mr. Emanuel Manson was considerably surprised to
see Paul walk into the office the morning after his arrival.
He was not aware that our hero was still in
Mr. Bradford's employ. Though it had been at first
suggested that Mrs. Palmer should come weekly to
receive a part of Paul's salary, Mr. Bradford afterward
decided to give his young agent a hundred dollars in
advance, which was placed in his mother's hands, and
obviated the necessity of her calling. Seeing and hearing
nothing of Paul, therefore, Mr. Manson naturally
concluded that he had been discharged, and was seeking
for employment elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Manson!" said Paul, politely.</p>

<p>"What, you here again?" exclaimed Manson, by no
means pleased.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am here again."</p>

<p>"It was hardly worth your while to come," said the
book-keeper, with a sneer. "We have no vacancy."</p>

<p>Paul smiled, for he saw what was meant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>"Is Julius here still?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is, and likely to stay. You needn't flatter
yourself you can step into his place."</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest wish to do so," said Paul,
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Because you are so prosperous, I suppose,"
sneered Manson.</p>

<p>"You've hit it, Mr. Manson. I am too prosperous
to wish to interfere with Julius."</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked the book-keeper, not
without some curiosity.</p>

<p>"I have been traveling for a house in this city."</p>

<p>"Indeed! It was a fortunate house."</p>

<p>"I agree with you, Mr. Manson. I have done very
well for them."</p>

<p>"You travel! I'd as soon send a baby."</p>

<p>"I dare say <i>you</i> would. Is Mr. Bradford in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he is busy."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I will venture to disturb him."</p>

<p>"You'd better not; he won't like it."</p>

<p>But Paul had already opened the door of the inner
office, and stood in the presence of Mr. Bradford.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul, Paul! I am glad to see you," said
the manufacturer, rising and shaking hands cordially
with our hero. "When did you arrive?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday afternoon, and I tried to get a chance
to call, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>"Of course, your mother wanted to see you. It's
all right. Now let me know all about your trip."</p>

<p>Paul gave a summary of results, and his employer
listened with evident surprise and approval.</p>

<p>"You have done splendidly," he said. "I did not
dream of realizing so much for the mine. And you
got the better of Fox, too. I value that as much as I
do the money you have made for me. Besides your
wages, I shall make you a present of five hundred dollars,
to show my appreciation of your services."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, Mr. Bradford, but I have
been handsomely rewarded by another party," and
he mentioned the two thousand dollars paid him by
Jim Scott.</p>

<p>"I am all the more pleased," said Mr. Bradford.</p>

<p>"I was not sure whether I ought to accept it," said
Paul.</p>

<p>"You were right in doing so, since it was neither
given nor promised till after you had sold the mine.
That, however, will make no difference with my gift."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he wrote a check for $500 and handed
it to Paul, who expressed his gratitude warmly.</p>

<p>"I have also," Paul continued, "made an investment
for you and myself."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"I had an opportunity to purchase a promising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
mine for three thousand dollars. I secured two-thirds
for you, and one-third for myself."</p>

<p>"So it seems we are partners, Paul," said Mr. Bradford,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, as far as that goes."</p>

<p>"Very well. I ratify your action."</p>

<p>At this moment a telegraph boy appeared with a
dispatch, which he handed to Mr. Brandford.</p>

<p>"What's this?" said the manufacturer. "Who is
Jim Scott?"</p>

<p>"The man I left in charge of our mine."</p>

<p>"Read that, then."</p>

<p>Paul took the telegram and read:</p>


<p class="blockquot">"Your mine is developing richly. Will you sell for fifteen
thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>Paul's eyes sparkled with delight, not alone at his
prospective profit, but at this proof of his financial
shrewdness.</p>

<p>"Well, Paul, what shall we do?" asked the manufacturer,
smiling. "It is your affair, and you shall
decide."</p>

<p>"We might sell half on that basis," suggested Paul.
"Very good. Write the dispatch, and it shall be
sent at once. Moreover, I will consider you half-owner,
and you shall give me back that check for five
hundred dollars. Then we shall have each invested
one thousand five hundred dollars."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>"Thank you very much, Mr. Bradford, I can hardly
believe this is real."</p>

<p>It was indeed hard to realize that besides the thousand
dollars which remained to him after the investment,
he would receive three thousand seven hundred
and fifty for the sale of half his share, and retain the
other half, which was probably worth quite as much
more. It was probably no exaggeration to say that he
was worth eight thousand dollars, while three months
since he was glad when he managed to earn eight or
ten dollars a week as a train boy.</p>

<p>"By the way, Paul," said the manufacturer, "I
hope you won't retire from business, now you are
rich."</p>

<p>"I should not like to be idle, sir."</p>

<p>"I will engage you to travel for my firm, then, and
your compensation will depend on your success. Will
that suit you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I can ask for nothing better. When
shall I report for service?"</p>

<p>"You may come here daily to get acquainted with
the details of our trade. I shall not send you out
again for a few weeks."</p>

<p>As Paul passed out of the office, the book-keeper
said:</p>

<p>"Well, won't Mr. Bradford take you on again?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>"I have never been out of Mr. Bradford's employment,"
answered Paul, smiling.</p>

<p>"What!" ejaculated Manson. "You don't mean
to say you have been traveling for our firm?"</p>

<p>"That is just what I do say. When I gave up
my position to Julius, I was promoted to traveling
salesman."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I never heard the like. Mr. Bradford
must be crazy."</p>

<p>Paul smiled, and went out. It was not long before
the book-keeper found how Paul stood, and his manner
changed accordingly&mdash;not from friendship, but
from policy.</p>

<p>As I write, Paul is nearing his twenty-first birthday.
On the day he attains his majority he is to be admitted
into the firm as junior partner. He is worth fully
twenty thousand dollars, and with his business capacity
bids fair eventually to become very rich. He has
bought a comfortable house for his mother, who, I
need hardly say, does not need now to take in sewing.
Near them live Grace and her artist husband. They
have recently returned from Italy, where Frederic Vernon
studied art enthusiastically, and with success. He
no longer paints portraits, but devotes his attention to
general art.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheldon is still a widow, and content to remain
so. She is thankful now for the narrow escape she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
had from Major Ashton, who would have dissipated
her fortune and made her wretched. Though she did
not approve Grace's choice of a husband, she became
reconciled long ago, and is an almost daily visitor at
Mrs. Vernon's happy home.</p>

<p>Stephen Palmer's temporary prosperity was owing to
a connection with counterfeiters. He fled the country
to avoid arrest, going first to Canada. Once he wrote
in great distress to Paul, and our hero sent him a
hundred dollars. For the sake of the relationship,
Paul would gladly set him up in some business; but
Stephen is a ne'er-do-well, and will probably never
amount to anything.</p>

<p>Mr. Manson, the book-keeper, is still at his post,
but Julius was long ago succeeded by another boy.
He proved too idle and careless even for his uncle to
tolerate. He envies Paul's success, but will never
emulate the diligence and fidelity which made it
possible.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
